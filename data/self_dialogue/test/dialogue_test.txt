i know my husband is a fisherman	yea mine too
im excited about the los angeles lakers future	me too i love the direction that the organization is going
not really i prefer stuff with singers	there are a good amount of electronic bands with singers well at least with words in them
yeah who are those two characters he makes friends with	timone and pumba
have you seen lost in space	the one with william hurt and matt lablanc
thats true	i guess he wasnt that tough
i like stuff like tim mcgraw allan jackson old kenny chesney etc	yes the good old music was the best
it wasnt even the best song in that movie	im not sure if we can be friends anymore
i see youre wearing gymsharks womens workout leggings and gym tights jan	yep they came in the mail yesterday
i do as well it is a great sounding instrument that is underused	who else do you like
no its all in english i actually held off on checking them out for a while because i thought that metal lyrics in french would sound kind of goofy	who else have you been listening to
yeah that whole scandal thing	yeah pretty dumb
they are surprising as well	i think they might make the playoffs
oh me to  i have all the other movies already	dang you really are a fan
how	if it works its chance it can work sometimes and the coach is a genius if it doesnt work hes an idiot
dk kahled is in it	he rides the horse
and do the talking on the field and not with your mouth	bellecheck is pretty good at keeping his guys quiet when stuff like that happens
theres something about aladdin that is just so charming	truly one of the best disney movies no contest
well they didnt need to develop some of the plotlines	sure they do the star wars universe is huge
did you see the new paul blart mall cop movie	you mean theres a second one
me too and the animation was good	it was do you want to see any other movies
you might be right about that	well their offence will probably make up for it
that is one way to go about it	are there any other good rookies this year
yeah how about highway to hell	one of the best songs they have
have you ever heard liberace play the piano	do you mean live
and how is watching a disney movie going to help	well in the movie the rat had a strong desire to cook and even though he was looked down upon for being a rat he never gave up
you didnt like will ferrell in the movie	yeah i thought he was ok
wait manuel is going to be stuck with the bills for six years	thats what they signed him for
i dont think ive heard that one	its not that special in terms of lyrics or anything just a good strong beat to move to
i liked the part in vietnam  it really effected forest and he really lost a great friend	that was a good part too  i wanted to cry for him
but voldemort and bellatrix are truly evil	they kill all the good people
please do not say thatlol	sorry just the cynic in me
have you seen guardians of the galaxy yet	not yet was it any good
wow he did	yep just last year
thats for the preseason almost two months before the actual season starts	i like the preseason just as much as the regular season
no but they were still good movies	yeah no doubt  all the gremlins movies have been great
what do you think is a great horror film	leprechaun is great
which of his movies do you find humorous	flight
its just a dream whats scary about that	because if he kills you in the dream you die in real life also that fact that you have to sleep eventually so there is no escape from him
me too he just needs a better supporting cast on defense	exactly their offense wasnt the problem last year
ah yeah its hard to go wrong there either	i dont know why but i can listen to it over and over again
where would you say you would stop watching the series	id stop watching at terminator 2 personally but part 3 is watchable
does brett garsed have any other albums	yes he has another one called dark matter
who are modern day rock singers or band are there many out there	oh yeah there are quite a few coldplay is definitely one of them
have you ever heard of richard cheese	no who is that
yeah i really enjoyed that movie  i thought it was a lot of fun to watch and an interesting twist on the original	it was  i really dont know why the reviews were so poor  its not like it was as bad as suicide squad
hes written just about every who song	yes he has
oh really  is that where he got his start	i guess you could say that
have you heard ed sheerans new album divide	i have i think that this is his best album yet
yeah it sucks	what song is it
hey man ready for this upcoming nfl season	you know it i love football
yeah thats right	umm im not a girl dude
do you want to go and watch wonder woman with me	i have been wanting to go and see it when do you want to go
i dont know someone that needs a qb	yeah maybe the broncos texans maybe the browns somewhere with a decent team that just needs a quarterback
i would say the nationals	whys that
during the 80s and 90s they had 19 top ten hits	thats quite a few they must have been really popular
yeah they toured with bad religion for a little	okay  i know who they are
yes exactly	i think so
who directed it anyways	richard marquand
you might have actually heard some of their songs	really do they have stuff that goes on the radio
i think that they drafted mccaffrey to put cam newton in better positions so that he wont run the ball as much	maybe although cam newton is the type of player that does front flips into the end zone i think that he will continue to put himself at risk for injury
hes always writing about how much he loves his daughters but goes off to abuse his wife and take sleeping pills	are you aware that hes been sober for a long time now
nope it has a lot of quiet introspective moments	thats different from other xmen movies
do you know what i do every halloween and christmas	what do you do every halloween and christmas
i know me too	well if you had to which one would you pick
i like the chainsmokers	yeatheyre pretty good
i think that they just did not have quite enough fire power	that and the fact that boston seemed to have a different guy get hot every game
do you believe the rumors that biggie smalls killed him	it would make a lot of sense if he did
remember when they got tossed in the garbage	i sure do
do you like other chevy chase movies	i think the caddy shack is one of the best he ever made
i loved this years gala i want to wear one of those dresses one day	it was indeed amazing i look forward to next year
do you watch action movies	yes i love them
does dc have a release schedule like marvel	i dont think so i know wonder woman is coming out
lyle alzado was the worse example of steroid use in the nfl	he had cancer they blamed it on steroids but no proof that caused it
if the bengals were owned by art rooney or bob kraft they would have won 6 super bowls with dalton	maybe but they dont have bill belichek or mike tomlin either
yeah im not sure i feel like it may be time to justmove on	that is what i hjave heard from quite a few people
yeah but its okay it was cheap	how much
apparently an allcello band called apocalyptica did a guest spot on one track	that is weird
whats that mean	oh just nirvana werent the first to be signed out of the scene
youd put it ahead of the original	i think that argument could be made
yes hes the main star he plays the companys ceos best friend and long time associate tj miller is the ceo jennifer aniston plays tjs mean spirited domineering sister and olivia munn is the company tech genius	was it just physical humor or were there a lot of actual crazy moments and funny lines
which beatles song do you think is the best then	help for sure its catchy and describes relationships well
yes and you can understand what they are saying	yes you can who is your favorite artist
yea did you see part two	no i didnt see that one
sing sing sing	how would i know that song
all thats overrated	and his songs are great
yep such a good actor	ill have to watch it again precious
neither do i	okay goodbye
in a direction where you would see something	the aura of not knowing was the entire plot
oh yeah if they had done it even 2 years ago it would be clunky and silly	for sure
what was his best period	the timeframe from 1969s everybody knows this is nowhere to 1978s rust never sleeps is to me unparallelled in music history his early 1990s resurgence is good work too but if you want the best stuff its the 60s and 70s you want
how many games do you think you will go to this year	well with the cost being so high id say i will feel pretty lucky if i can get up to one game
they havent played good in a long time that must be painful to watch	yea it has been what team are you a fan of
there is no denying his brand and style he played a really good 1970s hollywood talent agent	i agree i thought he was very believable he seems to embrace roles that are closely associated to his ethnicity
i also see the receiving corp being very competitive with another season under their belts	ive been waiting so long for savage to take the reins i am pretty excited to see him in action from game 1
he plays a boxer in this	wow i am definitely watching this now
maybe roman holiday	yes and then rear window
oh my gosh they had so many songs can you think of one	sexy eyes and only sixteen those were big hits
i like bruno mars quite a bit	he does have a lot of great songs
i think i like tom hanks the best	why him
its actually by george	i didnt know he wrote any of the songs
i think so fred and george weasley give it to harry potter so that he can sneak around the castle and even into town	thats right and then he sees peter pettigrew or wormtail on the map even though hes supposed to be dead
there were so many parts in that movie that scared me	that queen and the mad hatter were pretty terrifying
what is you favorite star wars movie	i liked the war of the clons the most
james franco	okay thats true nobody seems to like james franco
it really is  classical music is everywhere	even in commercials
yeah ive seen a bunch of good movies recently	oh yeah tell me about them
you going tonight	no i have tickets for next home stand
hello	hi there
you look like quite the star wars fan	thanks i would definitely consider myself a superfan
that song is not new	i just downloaded the song on my ipod
see i knew you would give in eventually hey when do you plan to go shopping this weekend i would love to go with you	im planning to go on saturday morning i have other things going on later in the day will you be able to come with you can give me feedback on the sheath dress
whats your favorite scene	what
she does have a pretty good voice	yes very distinctive
yes and it was later the next year before scott stapp joined them	so who do they sound like most do you think
so many options i know	id have to say the prestige
no it was supposed to be a serious drama but i feel like it would have been more successful as a comedy	well i guess it just proves even great actors can be in bad movies
did you at least have a neat concert somewhere	yeah we sang the national anthems at a torontooakland game in toronto
what about tobey maguire as spiderman	i wouldnt watch the spiderman movies if you paid me
i better hurry and buy my kids tickets to see cars 3 this weekend they are so excited	oh i forgot that was coming out i need to get tickets for my daughter too
bellinger is better	yes but he cant hit righties
the acting is awful though just horrible	are you telling me that mark hamill was not a whiny little brat as luke skywalker he was just shrill and awful
i do like the harry potter films	so do i
yep i loved them in the 1990s too	do you have any new bands you like
that should have warned people	i think we were so caught up in all the action of the movie no one put it together
me too	why
wait wait hold up too much too fast start over	whole tine scales do not have a very srtong sense of tonality or cente because the notes are same distance apart
do you ever wear dresses out at night	sometimes i have some beautiful mid calf length dresses that work well at night what about you
i love that movie such a good thriller and he has such a big part	who played his brother again
thats exactly how i felt	so you wanted the pats to win
oh yeah like the next jaws movie	i havent read any reviews about it but its a refreshing change from whats out now
oh dont waste your time worrying about something that wont happen	haha we should get tickets the next time the two play each other
you know they would not let just anyone do it	no it would be a huge film
what songs do you like that are pop	i like songs by one direction
defensive end	dont knoww the name
eyes wide shut is another one of kubricks with nicole kidman and tom cruise	i heard about that but never saw it  it was quite controversial
me too	what did you think of the finale
its like we cant find someone definitive to get our team back to the superbowl	well yeah not everyone is going to be a tom brady at winning
i agree steven tyler has a great voice	do you often listen to rock music
well what happened	i bought artpop when that was released
doesnt shakira have spanish songs	yes but i have mostly heard her english version ones my favorite is hips dont lie
i mean we see them in animated films pretty much	yeah its hard to think thats how it is
yes but much more interesting than he was in the cartoon	the details of the robots in the movie are so realistic technology has come a long way
do you like madonna	yes
that series between the pens and caps was impressive	totally i thought pittsburgh was going to run away with it after taking the first two in washington
oh wow me too  i have this awesome movie that was one of suzanne pleshettes first movies called a rage to live have you seen that	i have you will die when i tell you what im watching nowvalley of the dolls its on amazon thats the greatest kitsch musical ever
kind of more like partly a musical because they only kept half the songs and went for a more serious tone	it sounds very different but will i like this new version as much as the original
no whitney houston was sing it	i know but dolly parton wrote that song
seger has been around so long	i enjoy his music from the smokin ops right up through makin thunderbirds and like a rock
well i was thinking classic 80s rock like foreigner toto or kansas	my favorite was the fixx i love that song i reached the beach
could it happen to us what happened to cinderella and the prince	it may i feel but i know little about the magic
i think the most important aspect of modern music is the beat	there is plenty of evidence that people agree with you
me to he still can rap	i would buy his cd in a heart beat if he made something new
same here i watched it again recently and was amazed by the animations and songs	there was music in this film i guess i was really scared
what group was she in	she used to be the lead singer for destinys child
every idea borrows from something else	what do you mean
the strike year of 94 was devastating not to only the red sox but baseball in general	you see red sox fans would come back and show interest in the team no matter what but other teams did not have that luxury
well for instance lets say spiderman	that hasnt come out yet
just goes to show how quick time flies	no wonder my daughter calls me an old fuddy duddy
whos your favorite music group	the beatles for sure
what is your favorite romantic comedy	tough questions
okay whats your favorite genre of music	kind of hard to answer i have a couple
me too its probably not the same without paul walker	i know i cant believe hes gone
well now you know check this out as soon as you can	i will do this soon sinbad is such a cool name
each penalty shot is only worth 1 point typically if you make the first shot you get a second shot opportunity	so the three ways to make points are regular 2point shots 3point shots and penalty shots
well apparently there is a minor involved	no way dom has a kid
i really liked him and his friend havoc	yes they created a great duo
no there are lots of great songs on the album	you only told me about two songs you liked
the wolverine was great logan was fantastic	onehundred percent agreed on logan that might just be one of the best superhero movies of the last decade
he directed birdman and babel	oh no wonder he did a great job
like pod	yeah sure like them
also a favorite of mine	i went to their concert once and they were great
shes a big elvis fan i know that	then you should get her an elvis album
i love the song under the sea	doesnt that one crab sing that song whats his name
fine i will pick	okay
who then became the la raiders	who then became the oakland raiders
such a sensation isnt it	yeah recently she published another album called joanne i think its good as well
i definitely recommend it but if youre looking for something more family friendly i heard moana was really good	i took the kids to go see it they loved it the rock voices one of the main characters and he was a hoot to listen to
shazier is the best player on a pretty young and talented defense	hes getting there zeus is still king
what about gwen stefani	shes more pop
oh im sure by then there will be another princess to get into	totally
have you seen cabin in the woods	yes i have it happens to be one of my favorite horrorcomedy movies
did you have the thriller album	my brother did so i listened to a lot of the songs when i was younger
also runaway bride is good	1990s julia roberts really did a good job with the rom coms
do you think they should do away with the 1 and done rule	yes i think its hurting the college game more than its helping the nba
but i am having some troubles choosing	well how cheeky do you want it
its really cool how they set it up the dynamic is john goodman and mary elizabeth winstead as strangers locked up in the basement and theres a third guy in there too	off topic but every since watching scott pilgrim vs the world mary elizabeth winstead has been one of my favorite actresses
well it also has a backstory of a romance	of course
who are they what kind of music	its like pop you probably wont understand what theyre saying but youll like the music
she said that they felt too slow for her as a kid	are you going to watch them then
have you turned from any bands as in left or didnt wanna listen to them anymore	yes a few and out grew a few acdc and guns and roses i wanted to find more indepth none radio rock to really drive my music crave for rock
but split specifically had a good ending i think he developed that well	i would agree but its still not his finest work
like he says zut which is french for darn	cool
i loved them rhianna was my favorite	yes she really stuck to the theme of the night which was to celebrate fashion designer rei kawakubo
what have you been watching	well i saw moana at the cheap theater
what do you think of it	its pretty corny some people say its catchy but i dont see it
they did have a show about him	yeah but i want a real video
those are pretty good	i saw him on tour with elton john
so pens and preds in the finals	definitely
yes i think its going to be pretty scary	i watched the first one and couldnt sleep for a week
oh thats a shame  we always watch them on thanksgiving day for tradition	we are hoping for a year like we had back in the day
pretty much it is the center piece of the whole film	yeah he is also the most famous
yes i like them they were funny	i like them also they should make another one
thats good i think its important for girls to have role models	yeah i think that riley from inside out is a great role model
i think that is my favorite song	of the album
what else	they cooked up some deal with itunes
so whos your favorite	has anyone ever said amadala
did you like katy perrys album prism	i thought it was okay
they are	and the have good players
oh yes i remember that he was very classy about how he handled that situation	not to switch gears too much but what ever happened to brent musburger he was so good
hey are you going to see the new spiderman movie	are you kidding me  i love marvel movies  im going to see it on the night it comes out
did you see the prometheus  its got tie ins to alien	i did not know it was related to aliens
i was not aware of those	yeah they do them sometimes for charitygo to another country and play it is really cool
its not murderers row but youre right they traded chapman then resigned him now they have the prospects and chapman back	they built a lot of those deals with the cubs
will this be the year that buffalo finally goes all the way	the bills no they had their shot
there is so much enthusiam	exactly we didnt even win that game but i still had a blast
i like classical music a bit different than rap wouldnt you say	yeah they are very different but i think rap is very artful if done right
i think that song was in that viral hit with the guy with the wingsuit	yeah thats the one
i definitely know all the words who can forget them	yeah when belle is dancing with the beast and mrs potts is singing
did you ever watch the movie spy	who is in that one
same	isnt it crazy how theyre remaking them all now
but he went ahead and won supporting actor becoming the only person to win two oscars for the same performance	that is great i think i want to see that move
but he cheated when he did it	no he used modern technology instead of taking notes he videoed their practice
thats a great choice	what about you
whats your favorite pixar movie	either toy story or finding nemo
the visuals in the new version of tron were more vibrant the suits that the characters wear glow more realistically	in the original tron the suits that the characters wear glow too
i also like the song no	me too
are you into really weird movies	yeah why do you ask
did you see the movie princess protection program	the one with selena gomez and demi lovato
the very same	well its great to meet another vikings fan here in florida
billie jean was a great song on that album	that was one of my other favorites
would that be good for the team	i cant say but it seems to be good for business
how do you know this stuff	i am just brilliant
what about pachulia and hurting leonards ankledid you think it was a dirty play	i dont but everyone else thinks it was  look hes a clumsy guy and stumbled in  i dont think he has the skill to make that play intentionally
when we were younger we used to be big fans of the musical and the music	but you dont like them now
oh i heard a lot about that jordan peele right	yeah he wrote and directed it
yes and paul mccartney played bass on that song	i believe so i know he played bass somewhere on that album
hey have you listened to the band no doubt	the one with gwen stefani yeah ive heard some of their stuff
in what sense	it should be based on common sense from the ref
are you as excited as me for the upcoming nfl season	yes i need some football in my life in the worst way
do you think knick fans are to full of themselves	knicks fans are the jets fans of the nba
do you ever buy a movie sight unseen	rarely usually i will have at least rented it first
how can you watch this stuff its so boring	what baseball its an exciting game
ill be sure to give those a listen	i dont think youll regret it
you are right teams would have to put the majority of the focus on him which would open up other receivers	yeah the best chance defenses would have would be to rush brady so that he does not have much time to throw at all
his website and youtube channel are called cinemassacre	awesome ill check it out
really  when did that happen	well just in the past few years they released a couple albums and i think theyre coming out with another one soon
it was their last album released in 2001	no i cant say that i even knew about it
yes but they also have won 9 championships	what do you mean
i dont knowa day in life maybe	or if i fell thats a hard one to sing though with all that key changes
does elton john tour a lot	yes he has tours coming in 2017
well im supposed to start a conversation with you about music so what type of music do you like	im kind of odd about music
love jeff goldblum	he was great in it
he has been great in college and in the pross not even belichick can say that	talk to me when carroll wins a few more superbowls
did it have voice over at the beggining	no i dod not think that it did
well it takes more than that you have to be strong and have experience	elliott is also very quick have you seen how he can navigate through a tiny opening right down the middle
what is your favorite movie	maybe sunshine of a spotless mind
so i dont really get the end  what happened	its up to you to interpret it  maybe hes in a dream maybe hes not
doing well	what kind of music is your favorite
i will make sure to check it out then	oh she also wrote a book and did a really famous ted talk that you can find online to get more of an idea of who she is as a person
the funniest part was snape in the dress	that was classic
well since they are still performing can their music be played as such	sure but i dont know if i would play all u2 songs
he still has a tshirt that he bought at the show that night	cool i would like to talk to him about it one of these days
what	just find something
of course who is your favorite hero in the movie	i would have to say captain america
i remember it was so scary that they were forced to make second part less scary	well i dont see a point of making a horror movie that is not scary
it would probably be artificial nocturne	yes  i love that one too
thats not what i mean  you remember godzilla	yeah that thing was a trip  squashing and destroying that poor japanese town
who are you going for this season	i havent quite decided
i agree that might be one of the best offensive lines ever	yea that and elliot make them a real contender
did you see ghost protocol	yeah that was the best mission impossible theyve put out for a while
have you ever seen one flew over the cuckoos nest	yes i have i loved it
have you seen mississippi burning	no i have not seen that movie what is it about

man carr got paid by the raiders	well he had an awesome year last year
yo you going to see the new star wars movie the last jedi	dude the trailer looks amazing
who is your favorite rock singer of all time	if i had to choose just one id say eddie vedder
im not sure i know that wicket the first ewok that befriended princess leia was portrayed in it but i watched it for the first time a few days back and it seemed interesting	it is it does have some action in it limited only to the planet endor no space battles or jedi with their light sabers fighting one another kind of reminded me of a kids movie like dark crystal or  labyrinth
did you see the last one prometheus	i did  that was different
right hes only in the film for a few seconds but his presence has a terrific impact	thats for sure and mark hamill is excellent he fits right into the role as if hes never left
pittsburgh had trouble with washington	well they were a truly stacked team
does it say what time the game starts	it starts at noon  who are you rooting for
i so enjoyed lady gagas half time superbowl  show	her voice has such great pitch
yes i like the dance ones too	you know he never really played the guitar
is that why youll see baseball players play well into their 40s	that is indeed true and players can play 2025 years as a pro
sort of but not really its a lot more classic blink than alkaline trio	oh thats kind of a bummer to hear but good on the classic blink though
my mom has a 3disc cd and plays it constantly	well i like beatles music a little but wouldnt want to hear it constantly
lively is one way to put it i dont like metal a lot	well you mightve not heard the right bands then
and amazing songs	yeah and amazing song
its a classic one	cool
yes she is	and i love her songs
okay and what sort of things do you listen to now	i listen to a lot of jazz miles davis nat king cole that sort of thing
what was the name of the song	i believe it was nothing holding me back
it is about a man who has puppets that come alive	that sounds like an interesting movie
correct	im glad i got at least one of them
its like a throw back to their original album	i did think that was their best
i think hes the best superhero and the best superhero movie	exactly hes so awesome
yeah cause she been coming every year and winning every year	yeah you right
it has a repetive beat	thats how a lot of songs are though its not bad
i didnt know they were still around	you see dont get so stuck in the past or youll miss out on whats happening right now
so i was building a snowman this afternoon and it reminded me of that song from frozen	do you want to build a snowman
yeah everyone knows bohemian rhapsody	somebody to love is okay too
i like pop music basically anything that comes on the radio	i dont think that will impress a girl whos into classical music
yeah you know its i didnt see any obvious look at my ass in the trailer	no i mean it looks like theyre taking this seriously taking her seriously as a character
what type of music do you listen to	i tend to listen to more pop or top 25 hits on the radio
i think i will too	great
yea they have a classic sound	that im sure noone will forget
i just really like that final meeting between luke and vader	yeah that is good but i think the famous reveal in episode five is better
the reason is largely because they have some of the most intelligent lyrics	oh really i did not know that
isnt that dc their last movies werent that great	it is but all the reviews have been really positive about this one
and jim mcmahon was quarterback i remember him being sort of a bad boy always wearing a headband and sunglasses	and so many lineman on that team too who went on to make the hall of fame
i was heartbroken when they went their seperate ways	yes but they came back together in the end
did you hear latest tom cruise movie	are you talking abut the mimmy
i agree what else do you think george lucas screwed up	i think there is too much added stuff in the mos eisley scenes in the redone movies
you dont like them anymore	i dont like number four as much anymore it had been a while since i saw watched it with someone else and well all kinds of flaws started to show up
oh nice what else can a man want	exactly well do you go to the movies much
i got to see lord huron in concert last night they were great	who are they again
still need defensive work	theyre an enigma sometimes really good
they are exciting	exactly
oh neat	yeah it was fun
i wish mine were a fox	you never know  it could be a giraffe for all you know
all these main stream artists are jumping on the dance music movement and sampling tracks from the underground scene have you noticed	like who
do you still play the trumpet	a little i forgot a lot of it
the kentucky wildcats have the best freshmen class coming in so they have a great shot	i agree a little i guess i just hate the one and done guys
yeah one of them sang brittany howards verse on that one song from his new album	what song did he end on
the packers scored 14 in the third and 7 in the final quarter	kc
exactly you must be a true fan then if you know that	well yeah ive been going to mariners games since the kingdome days
but the movies bring them to life though	but they cannot match the books
like what	well i really liked bobby browns early stuff i like gangstas paradise
think the lions will do anything	matthew stafford is a good quarterback but i dont think they have the team
i believe so but im not sure to what extent	wasnt it based on a true story
if he does have a good year then they definitely have a team that can win a lot of games	last year they were without jj watt for much of the season
what type of music do you like best	i like to listen to pop music
plusblur is still making music together	thats true
im having trouble deciding between happier and galway girl	i like those ones too
me too but frozen is my favorite	yes i like how the love story is about sisterly love not romantic
seriously i havent but would love to	shes awesome in concert really fun and interactive with the audience
yeah but this one includes their search for alcohol	theres something new teens and alcoholhow novel
they are really exciting and fun to watch	they are and the actors are great
that is a cool name are they still famous	yes and they inspired many other metal bands
the movie was long and drawn out and too loud	thats how i felt about the last transformers
its crazy how that movie could keep you interested with barely any talking for so long	i cried and got so attached to the volleyball wilson
what is your favorite song of adeles	i love rolling in the deep
not only that there was this huge chase scene	yeah i remeber
i always compared tebow and manning tebow was organic and exciting manning was cool and collected	it youre gonna say tebow was better than manningim out of here
maybe	watch it ill rent your next movie for you if you dont like this one
yeah but this took it to a new level	they already had the plot in place just needed new characters
so did you ever listen to bon jovi	oh yeah i loved bon jovi  he was one of the greatest artists of the nineties
have you heard of the the williams singers	no i havent heard of the williams singerswhat kind of songs do they sing
i guess i might think twice	it might be a good movie regardless
do you think madonna will continue her career	no i think she is getting too old
i dont want to give away too much of the movie	i know i will have to go see it for myself
yes he has a lot to live up to with the bears	he will need to become a franchise quarter back for them
i think charlton heston played the main character	oh and peter pan was about pirates kinda
walle	huh never heard of it
it will be an ethical dilemma to think about	sure will be
they are really good at it	oh but still
i thought this movie did a good job of establishing who he was as a person	he started off as kind of a jerk
it was awesome  they played tons of new songs from their album that will be coming out	they have a new album soon
you think anyone is about to have a comeback season	cam newton he might get the panthers back this year
have you seen finding dory	yes i took my kids to see it last week
they tried letting him pitch at the beginning of the season but that didnt work out	oh yeah  didnt go over well
oasis	why
ya  it is an interesting thing to see how differently the females are being portrayed now i liked having the female hero	me too but i worry now that it seems to be repeating itself anything done too much gets boring
what is your favorite best picture winner	i think that should be obvious  rocky
have you seen the movie calledchucky	yes i have is it about that doll that looks like a clown
none of them  new yorks 1970 and 1973 teams are the only titles they have won	oh the teams with reed frazier and debusschere  well nice talking to you and for your own sake consider rooting for another team
he has a great voice	completely amzing
they sure were they were even nominated for an academy award for power of love	i didnt know that  did they win
because i am certain	well you sound like it
personally i like the steelers i think they have all the ingredients they need to win	what about the packers

or polka haha  quite a variety all the hard metal rock too	id be interested in trying some of that out  any suggestions
i just dont see where okafor fits in	either does colangelo
the second is such a joy especially because sequels are usually bad	toy story 2 was almost better than the first
they are really long i cant sit there that long	yea i can understand that
that is a very emotional song i prefer america more upbeat and fun	officer krupke is another fun one
who was the last batter to hit over 400  the averages seem to have gone down as the homers increased	that would be ted williams in 1941  he was up there on the all time home run list about 521  he had a high average for his lifetime too
well she also had people sitting around the table pretending to seductively eat the fruit	yeah i figured there had to be something more to it it seemed to basic

i think we need to go out tonight	do you
thats a little bit different since the show has been off the air for so long its not a direct continuation	i guess the reno 911 movie would be a better example huh
i agree  its scary hearing about all the retired players suffering from cte and the recent story about warren sapp feeling like he is already dealing with issues at a young age make me think things need to change	definitely  hopefully the steps will begin when children begin playing football at a young age  back to the actual game who do you think will win the mvp award
i cant believe curry fouled out  he never does that	i know its like the refs had him under a microscope
i really enjoy close your eyes	that is a really good one why is that your favorite
oh yeah i guess they would be considered rock	exactly my point
its called the others	oh i gotcha  yeah i remember that film
the team is just not so good	they just have to pull together like any other team look they have some really good players

who introduced it	ben kenobi
melissa mccarthy	oh i bet it was good then
it looks like they have no problem moving teams now	it is just too much
theyve had some good ones but troy aikman so many years ago was the last superstar quarterback for them	its going to be a fun game when the cowboys play the packers this year
who was the shortest player to ever play in the nba	that would be muggsy bogues
mine was probably the little racals	oh man that is a classic i loved porky in it and also how they featured whoopi goldberg
yes you dolt	i know im joshing you
oh my god i love samuel l jackson	so do i hes hilarious
she had a wonderful voice	it also starred christopher plummer
it was pretty epic	so much so they put it in the video game
he easily could have won 20 games the way the sox hit behind him	i know and even though i always liked the guy he threw a real stinker in last years playoff appearance

that is an awesome theory	heywood floyd is supposed to be a propagandist

i hope the stelers do well this year	i agree i love teasing my husband about how great they are compared to the saints
who is the best rock and roll band of all time	most people would probably say the beatles or the rolling stones
alright ive only heard of kendrick and nas do the other 2 sound like them	not really but itll be good to change it up im sure youve heard future before he does the song that goes molly percocet
what disney movie do you like	new or old
i love movies that take me on an adventure like that	i like when that adventure has good music too
i wasnt very hungry i only had a chicken burrito a burger two hot dogs and 7 beers	who helped you out of the stadium or did you just roll down the steps
the way he threw that and took out the statue was awesome	and he killed people with it
i really enjoyed some of their darker albums though	did you like any man in america
yeah there are a couple of really funny supporting characters that add a lot to the film	it sounds like a wellrounded comedy
yes i think thats a new category for disney	im glad to see disney making more diverse films
i mean maybe overrated but not awful	i prefer alice in chains
yes id definitely say so i know one of their songs got really popular its called the sound	that sounds really familiar but im not sure if i recall it are there any certain songs or albums you suggest
thats a good one	i just heard it in the car
so maybe rap today would be better if he were still around	i think it definitely would
right is dodgers and giants	thats right they are playing in san francisco
of course it is	well how do we do it together
havent we been down this road before	over and over again
yeah tom bradys worst nightmare	definitely the new york giants
oh yes i love that song too i like the ending where lennon is making that sound as the song reaches a crescendo	man the beatles were the best group ever there will never be another group like that
he and derek carr seem to have something going with one another	yea they have excellent chemistry on the field together
i would love to see them play blue live ive never seen them do it	that was one of my favorite music videos that they ever put out
they have won 3 afc championships	in the beginning the owner wanted to by the chicago cardinals
yeah it was as funny as the show	it was kinda like an extended show to me
whos the bad guy in the batman movie	it has all of them but joker is the main bad guy
basically yeah he created a motif that represented him using his initials in the german style of notation and put it through hell	so hes like the trent reznor of classical music
i will say that the special effects were pretty good it had some pretty funny spots in it too	really i didnt really think it would be a comedy
well thats fashion	yes it is
oh yeah she was elroys estranged wife	i think so i just remember her shooting the machine gun at them at one point

who is your favorite rapper	i love tupac
do you know if there are recordings of those shows	yes you can find them on spotify
do you think nickelback deserves all the hate they get	no i actually love them
which brings me back to my original question why did they turn childs play into more comedy than horror and suspense	i told you  probably to change it up and not be the same stuff all the time
critics have given it really good reviews so far	what critics like and what the people like can be very different
go on then make me jealous	well i grew up in the 80s so i got to see bands like primal scream teenage fanclub and jesus and mary chain when they were starting up
oh yeah theyre great too	i think that old music has a style to it that just cant be duplicated today

any and all kinds of music just the best singer	i have to go with whitney houston

watching anythin in particular	nah just gonna surf around
his song blue is my favorite	okay i will check it out
me too my heart belongs to you is my favorite of theirs	they pretty much defined 90s era rb if you ask me
please do if you like whos that girl you should enjoy it and ricky martin is very talented too	he is i bet their voices sound amazing together
that is really crazy if you could take polyjuice potion to turn into any character who would it be	probably professor mcgonnagall shes whip smart and is one of my favorite characters in the series
it almost has a spanishflamenco sort of feel	sounds interesting
yes in a way	always have to have the love interest
id say love song was her really big hit originally	oh yes that is it the video is good too
do you know if the movie abattoir is good	it is interesting but not for everyone do you like the work of darren bousman
they made him more ditzy and he did not seem as hardcore as he once was	oh man that is disappointing
well thats really what chamber music was for imagine being a king or a prince and you want to party who better to invite over and jam with than a few of your favorite musicians	thats wild thinking of medievalist and romantics partying in their homes like we do today
what do you think of terrell owens	terrell owens was a great receiver but there were always drama issues
i liked the second pirates of the caribean movie the most what about you	well my favorite is the first one
he was okay he was really handsome but i didnt love his acting	was there anyone else who stood out
yeah them dudes had that classic philly sound	i know but harold melvin was jealous because teddy was getting all of the shine
how is your day going so far	it is has been very boring up to this point
so what are some that are better than the original	jeez that is hard it would have to be a star wars one i think
not seargant peppers	no i think that was great but let it be sort of let it all go and said this is what we are
yeah like in beauty and the beast i like belles dad	oh sure he was funny and invented some really interesting things
i agree ill never doubt that but we cant know just how good because of the cheating that they were caught doing and confessed to there is probably more well never even know about	they probably would have still won all of those super bowls
how tall is lady gaga	shes 5 foot 1 inch
what year did steve young retire	he retired back in 1999
what kind of music do you listen to	several different types rock alternative country
did they leave the ending open for a part three	yes they did
no not really	how about a list of genres then
i do like coldplay though i used to listen to a lot of their stuff	i do too but i have to be in the right mood for it because sometimes their music is so slow and sad it can be tough to listen to
i dont know if all of the versions were disney though	it would be cool if they did another version like how beauty and the beast used real life actors
you can say that about kirk cousins on the skins	yeah he is definitely hit or miss
since the early 2000s	really  i didnt know they had been around that long
but what about defense	i know they are weaker than the caps
yeah thats yngwe malmstein he really ruins it	i never thought about it that way
show case for what	for the new recruits they show off what they can do how they fit with the teamm etc
i know he cost the cowboys a lot of games too	he really did with all those interceptions he threw
how much do you know about the first super bowl	i know it was green bay packers against the kansas city chiefs and that the packers won
what about the team arent you sure about	first off the quarterback
crazy amazing and crying	i think i remember those songs
and where do they get all their samples anyway	james brown the temptations others i like hearing black artists represented you dont see enough of that these days
elgars cello concerto	who was the soloist
yes but manu is 39 years old he can only do so much	thats true i guess the other players will have to step it up
i enjoyed it alot	i love how she got to see her parents at the end
i know it was so corny but their music was just so catchy	of course everyone knows wannabe but i think my favorite song was actually stop
it was excellent	what was so excellent about it
i must say they do they have lots of great albums also	yeah i just download a few songs today
no he just has a lot of great performances	and this one is not as great as any of his best work
yes luis fonsi did you see this guy is on the peak position of the 100 hot on the billboard 19 weeks on the chart that is impressive for a latin artist	yes you are right the last time an artist had such success was in 1996 21 years ago los del rio were 14 weeks in the no 1 with their song macarena
he was able to save belles life because of being the best	i think a gun would have scared them away
i had not that about that one but thats good keep going	both the beatles and the jackson 5 have won grammy awards for their group work
yes the burnt orange one with the cut out panels and the long skirt split	orange is really big in designer fashion lately
there have also been some pretty badly dressed characters in the movies though	yes indeed at least every film set in warm weather seems to feature someone with a mismatched tropical outfit of some kind
how was it i was thinking about going to see it	it was nice my kids really enjoyed it even though they had never seen the original cartoon version
is there anyone else who died in that movie	a sith apprentice
so have you heard if any of the other members of the dead are going to be getting together anytime soon for another concert or anything	no i sure havent  itd be one hell of a show if they did
were talking about historical accuracy in disney princesses	mulan was based off a chinese poem pocahontas is an important historical character theres more leeway for fiction than actual historic events
it was a big hit back then the two of them sang great together	well she really did better when she was solo
do you listen to much pop music	its kind of a guilty pleasure lots of top 40
why dont you like cage	he gets credit for nothing and performers put it on their resume without doing anything
you never know with the way the universe is going	they are handling it well
mlb needs to use him as the example of game pace	hes really really good
they did the villains very well bane was very well portrayed	yes tom hardy did a great job in that movie
yeah parents are dumb and dont see truth a lot	so why did you quit
what dont you like about them	i just dont really care for all that slapstick comedy not my thing
my hopes are high i am pretty excited about where we are right now	being a lions fan has been painful over the years so i am keeping my hopes in check
more than me though ever since having a child its been tough to listen to music like i used to	ok let me think do you know who vince staples is
yes he did he started with lennon and mccartney at the age of when the band was the quarrymen	wow then what
when they are being chased by the submarine through russia	oh yeah theres some great action scenes
do you like fifth harmony	oh yeah i love fifth harmony
man these tunes are rocking	what are you rocking out to
how much are the vikings worth	i think every team is worth at least a billion dollars now last time i looked the vikings were valued at 800 million and that was 5 to 6 years ago
do you really want me to tell you	yes tell me
so part of why you like it so much is because it calls back to the first one	exactly  what is the best karate kid movie
you wouldnt think so but once you delve into it a bit the complexity becomes overwhelming	how so
well 20 years later kevin hart is stuck at a boring job that he hates when suddenly the rock contacts him with a new name and asks him if he wants to hang out	but really the rock is a spy right
have you seen any disney movies recently	yes i saw enchanted
what music decade is your favorite	i would have to say the 80s
i also love the song o holy night	that one is beautiful as well i sang that in a concert one year
why is it a big deal	if you are really a fan then you devote a lot of yourself to the team you want to see them do well
its okay time passes quickly	yes it does
did you ever get a chance to watch tarzan	is that the disney movie
i want to watch a good horror movie do you know of any good ones	i like the rob zombie films
more like all of it one pill and you have a triple digit iq and perfect recall of everything youve ever seen heard or read	okay but whats the downside
are there some songs that you genuinely like though	i liked your welcome actually
he was a creepy dude	that was sort of neat how it all linked together with the kids parents
thats okay with me i was getting tired of watching them win all the time	you know who ive been really impressed by the cleveland indians
wow i did not realize there were so many men villains too	i guess there is an abundance of both
yeah i dont think theyll shorten the season either that would mean less revenue	and i hope they dont lengthen it either it really doesnt need to be any longer than it already is
i heard those 2 songs have broken quite some records	yes indeed and i personally like them very much
i said bambi was the best disney movie ever made everyone has seen and knows and loves that movie	it was really touching and the animals were so cute

i want to go to a show so bad	what sort of show
anyways it was great talking to you	same
yeah i wanted to have high hopes for the browns this year but i dont think i can	they had a good draft this year
dont forget the pirates franchise	thats right  while the first was the best in my opinion the second and third movies were worthy additions
yeah hes awesome not only is his music great his personality is too	really hes not like most famous people that dont have time for fans
that is just insane	that is the point i think it would be awesome
the bridge jump race	oh yes of course i remember
yeah but their starting pitching has to better	no doubt about it their starting pitching is holding them back
i know and the twist at the end was great	have you seen any other horror movies in 2017
why them	why not
sure	we can watch come classics
hard to believe it was a cohen brothers flick	yeah a bit off beat for them
shes very good actually  the made her look less glamorous than she usually looks	does she and pacino have good chemistry

should we do an aladdin movie night	sure i have a copy i even have the sequels
me too i think i like billy madison best or whos your daddy	its so hard to pick but i really like happy gilmore

599 plus tax	did you like it
how about you stacy and i hook up and hit the mall	i dont know if i am feeling like going to the mall today i look a mess
no it was just a little strange to see him there	yeah he should have just been in the originals
i really love western movies	i do too
he is and it is a great song i miss music like that	same here we should try and bring jazz back into the mainstream
i do like the idea of having an all star team though	yeah and most other sports teams have it
for sure every soundtracks shes been on has been a hit like jay z umbrella	she did a great job with eminem love the way you lie
hey did you see the trailer for that new movie about emojis	yeah it looks kind of weird like it will be forgotten as a movie pretty soon
yeah the three of them are pretty similar the third and last one is about craig and day day trying to collect rent money after being robbed by santa claus on christmas eve	now that just sounds silly

yes youre going to love them	maybe it will even inspire us to learn italian
i did the music was awesome and emma watson did a great job	she played belle right shes a good actress
i agree it had a strong sense of love	oh the anne hathaway love monologue was a little corny i thought
really never heard of it i thought only nashville has country music	not at all willie nelson waylon jennings garth brooks and george strait can all be considered part of the first and second generation of the red dirt genre
what do you mean by that  of course they are	well theyve just had a lot of electronic stuff lately
oh my goodness is that some kind of record	sure is largest margin of defeat

no cant believe he broke his leg right away i think theyre still set up pretty well though	yeah its hard to imagine anyone can stop either the cavs or the warriors
thatll be an easy win for the patriots	you think so i think the chiefs are looking pretty good this year
what do you think of darth vadar	i thought he was a very interesting character i liked seeing the progression he made
yes thats the movie its a smaller indie movie i think but it got raving reviews from critics at the film festivals	is it a horror movie i cant tell from the photos ive seen or the from the title
while this could be true i dont envision it happening	their minor league is so stocked its alarming
what would hold them back or rather what do they have to do to overcome repeating basically the jacksonville side of the last decade	it all goes back to bortles and who is going to play rg and te on the offense as well
did you ever listen to sugarland	the old country band of course
harrys new album is so different from his one direction songs	i agree its more rock than pop

what do you think jj watts	what about him
it was hard to see christian bale cut off his own thumb	i didnt like seeing the canary get killed
i wonder if theyll ever reexplore those movies with joseph gordonlevitt	unlikely but you never know
do you remember your first animated disney movie growing up	its hard to recall but i think it was either the 1938 snow white and the seven dwarves or the 1942 bambi what about yourself
yeah he did alright its just a shame that the movie he debuted in as batman wasnt that great	i agree batman v superman had so much potential
they were disappointing	why do you say that
aghhhhh i want to get in the stadium already	dude youre going to cause a fuss
theyre a young team but should be better this year than last	given all that i just dont think the falcons have it in them

they used old footage and had a body double	that was pretty well done
he always is playing hurt from what i can remember	that is no lie he is a tough guy though
what do you take rap to be	well clearly rap is poppy radio crap that has more repeated hooks than actual verses right
yes kevin hart and the rock	was it good
have you heard of lmfao	doesnt that mean in short laughing
yes and im so sad about it he was far too young	not as young as kurt cobain or layne staley when they died
so did mine	i wonder if they will come out with another one
do you think the steroid guys should get in the hall of fame	yes with an asterisk
whats your favorite disney movie	im not sure maybe cinderella
i think i will be going to the chicago game week three	that is smart
yes because i follow him on youtube and he hadnt posted anything in a while and now he is trying to get viewers all of a sudden	well i do hope you are right
its like a long treble and bass control usually with about ten to twenty dials or levers for adjusting the sound	oh ive got that on my mixcraft software itll drive you nuts playing with the sound like that
they are extremely linear but they are beautiful movies they have too many songs though	i agree i prefer how japanese movies interlace music into the mood of the film without constantly making music the focus
he was in the hunger games movies	who did he play

i loved it it was everything i hoped it would be and more	awesome im going to see it this weekend tell me how it was without spoilers

yesand hes ringo brother in law	thats right he got married after the beatles broke up

me too such a long movie	i wonder if the remake is just as long as the original
yeah honestly some can get boring but others are good forever	one time i listened to loud pipes by ratatat for a week straight
marcus allen no question	al davis had a personal vendetta against allen
you are making me want to go through my old album collection	its that time do it and turn on the disco ball
do you like lady gaga	i am not a big fan

youre crazy  hes got awesome hands	but he drops a lot of passes led the league a few years back i think
lee is great when hes healthy which is not often	i think that between lees leadership and some promising players in the defensive secondary defense should not be a major issue for dallas

yeah that was horrible  probably worst pixar movie ever	with the exception of up
did you like it  what was it about	i did like it  i was just thrilling and action filled to keep my attention  plus there are one liners that are hilarious and whitty  the main character samuel jackson wasnt a good guy or a bad guy  he wanted the right things done

it was really scary	and creepily

i really like hounds of love	side 1 is totally out of this world not one misstep
well ralph towner is know for his diversity in music from working in classical to world	how interesting are you familiar with fryderyk chopin
there was a star studded cast	ok what else was great
did you hear tom brady has written a book	no is it about football and the nfl or about his personal life
lady gaga is awesome the way she can do so many styles of singing	she brought a lot of modern energy to the song while at the same time blending in with the traditional icon tony bennett
hmm so i shouldnt start with the prequels	i dont think you need to some people like watching the old one after one or two though as a flashback
yeah that was disgusting imagine if that were real life	thatd be so gross
i didnt its the same reason chris pratt made the decision in the first place he had no choice	yea but people can harbor resentment for a long time
august is also the time for the sourwood festival where they celebrate their famous honey with food honey tastings and local musicians	when do these people work and sleep it sounds like a nonstop party
it really had a terrifying story to it though	yeah i wouldnt want to be stuck in their home
yea i will pass on that one but i would definitely like to hear her do a mix with country music	i dont know about country music that would definitely be an interesting collaboration for her
but if you had to pick one	i suppose snow white and the seven dwarfs because it took so much to get it made
yeah why do other teams always choke and do the stupidest things against the organization that is always up to something suspicious weird	buccaneers were pretty good at the end of last year winston was coming into his own

its my favorite doors album	what an album to go out on

their latest is called goths its about goths	excellent
yes vin desiel is still in the movie and also dewayne johnson	i love them both as actors
rock music just isnt what it used to be	there are a few good bands out right now some cool songs
did she win any of the grammys that year	she won the grammy for best electronic album and the best dance recording
guess i wont watch it	yes his xmen roles were the best
maybe so because alex was cute in his own way and he did a great job at the comedic parts	the supporting actors all did such a great job in this movie they helped make the movie great because they were all so good in their roles
i bet i would agree that the cowboys have the best stadium what other stadiums stand out	i would have to say that seattles stadium is pretty spectacular as well
i suppose you would see it that way but he did make up for past mistakes	you think tell that to harrygrowing with the dursleys and always having voldemort trying to kill him at least voldemort let him finish school each year
some of the newer music is good but i just really like the classics the best	i tend to agree with that i dont necessarily feel the same about springsteen though
oh yes  but not in a bad way	thats good to hear
well the cowboys have dak prescott appleby and rush	ok i guess that makes sense
sometimes i feel like you never know what weird sounds will come on next in some of his songs	i think some songs are definitely like that
i like primus too	you cant go wrong with pearl jam
what is your favorite rock song	cliche and famous or not
me too  id like to see one or more of the movies just because hes in them	the newest one is called the fate of the furious and its got some big name actors in it
he is a comedian but he is also a really good song writer and rapper	really what kind of stuff does he rap about

i do like kate mara a lot and have seen a lot of her movies	same here i liked her in shooter as well
stuff breaks that patriots way a lot	even when brady was out last year they found a way to win
with the falcons getting the new stadium this year that would be great too	we will see what happens if oaklands quarterback doesnt get hurt at the end of the season they might go further this year
its about guys from the mafia who take over a casino	that sounds pretty interesting

i wonder if they will show how the xenomorphs are created	that wasnt really clear in prometheus
i think some people just burn too bright for this world  music icons shine the brightest i suppose	yes its a shame

do you think dwayne allen will have a shot in new england	i dont know he did not do that well before
i got interested in the nba again last year when i saw seth curry making so many 3 pointers i would tune in just to see how many he made	he definitely made it entertaining
i think he be touring overseas	i think i heard something like that who else was live from philly
oh ok well i think they should have stopped after the 2nd one	no they should have made one and then been done with it
i feel the same way actually i dont enjoy dub step unless its paired with a song i like	i just dont see the appeal if its not paird with anything
the acting is top notch	how mant movies are their
thats the movie i really enjoyed all the shots of food and the meals it was funny and heart warming too	i was so hungry when watching that remember when he made the grill cheese sandwich my mouth was drooling
have you seen the movie life yet	no but i want to  i heard its pretty good
i love jason sudeikis	well youll love him in that because hes a riot its a character bit and its highly ridiculous but he makes it work beautifully

maybe she will sing all of those in her concert	i hope so i cant wait to see her performance
no you can get english subtitles	does that take away from any of the thrill
i know and the first strings only play the first quarter	well they do have to check out the rookies and see who is in and who is out

do you like cage the elephant	i love cage the elephant
well that makes sense so the peter jackson ones then	which ones are those
did it have a happy ending	actually no it did not
yes but it was hard to follow because i didnt watch the first one	eh the polot is kinda convoluted with a lot of new characters in the sequel so even if you watched the first one it would still be kinda weird
they are both very popular how long have you been a fan	i have liked them both for a long time
i think songs with lyrics can do the same thing	well they can but its easier because you can say a bunch of things that would envoke an emotion
do you like the new disney movies better like brave or the older ones like the little mermaid	i like the older onesthe hand drawn ones sleeping beauty is my favorite but i really love all the old cartoon styles
did you notice anything original about that movie	well one thing ive never seen before was how they had his point of view sometimes and how they portrayed it
thats right you know its rumored that his sister actually wrote some of his pieces but the patriarchal society meant it had to be published in his name	i do its one of the few mozart rumors that has any solid evidence behind it that it might be true
i know i was singing along to it	i always sing along to it
what was the last harry potter movie you saw	i saw one of the deathly hallows
one i like is run the jewels	thats an unusual name for a rap group
i sure am	we cant talk now
why not  i think hes a pretty good rapper	he seems talented enough but he just seems fake
who is your favorite pop artist	to be honest i really like justin beiber as his songs are so catchy
true you see them adjust a lot	i also see a lot of balls curving real close to the end zone but straight and true up until that point
will smith and tommy lee jones make a great team	they do
is what you found true	sort of with progressive rock in the 70s there was a huge variety of instruments being worked with
she even does the celine accent	yeah she hits it spot on

same here if its anything like the new jungle book its going to be amazing	we definitely should go see it when it comes out
other than that i was extremely impressed	how were the animated objects
that was sad	corny as this is i even cried when the beast died in beauty and the beast
looking back at his first performances on american idol he was good but so young	oh yeah
yeah that would be too easy so its only movies	id maybe say avengers age of ultron then
well pick one	i guess zoolander would be one

not a big disco fan	disco was terrible some of the corniest music around
yea it was good	night fever was one of their big dico hits
this is the worst  this may be the worst turkey day ever	you can stop crying now because i rented a 56inch plasma tv from rentacenter for thursday i am smart enough to know that if you didnt get to see football on turkey day then you would not let anybody else digest any of this food all day
not at all	what was their last big us hit
well theyll certainly be more of a challenge than utah and portland	yeah those series were a joke
mark wahlberg tyrese gibson and terrance howard are all in it	cool so whats the movie about
really	yea but it wont be as good as the original one
yeah not violent though	hmmm i might know a good one
how would you convince other people to think that way	ha thats easy i would prove to them he deserves it
you need to watch it	why is that
i am interested to see how the cowboys do this year	me too i was surprised by how well dak prescott played
do you ever listen to popular music on the radio	only when my kids turn it on
she is a fairly annoying actress i guess	well i certainly think so judy greer does have a small part in the movie though so thats good  i love judy greer
what do you mean	well what has been popular has been changing through out time
do you think they are an all time great group	i would have to say yes
he could play that chess like game	and fly the space ship
you going to the show	i might go if i have time then have you seen any good shows lately
i was afraid he was going to drop his underpants	thats the adult version it comes out next year and stars jack black in all his undisguised glory
yes i know hes an older actor but they really made him look weak	ill always think of him as the might captain picard from star trek
to me that pretty much signaled the end of the indiana jones ever being in danger	agreed  kind of takes the mystery out of it
have you ever seen one flew over the cuckoos nest	yes easily one of the top 5 movies ever made
why do you think you lost	at the time woody allen had a difficult reputation
that doesnt help but its not just that his other movies have all seemed to do bad too	i cant think of any hes been in recently
i wonder what gagas next era is going to be what kind of sound her album will have	im hoping she touches back on some dancepop stuff shes so good at it
he and estelle escape the lab but she is capture by akans mercs and henry is beat up and thrown off an overpass there he meets a guy named jimmy who helps him	so henry goes after akan to get estelle back
i wonder if my toys do that	well overall that movie was so creative and fun
i completely agree i love all those artists the same	the early 2000s aftermath production team was just off the wall
it is honestly just sad to see	i agree their is no telling how they will do with a unknown
yeah that was probably the best set piece of the entire series	it must have cost a fortune to film
did you like the sandman	i liked the scene where he came to life
that could be true honestly	i havent seen the movie in a while
i heard about iron man the actor is very famous	yes robert downey jr is one of my favorite actors
you have to watch it it is one of my favorite movies ever	my brother always talks about what a great film that it is
youre right by the way did you know that christopher nolan and his wife where executive producers on the film	really whats his wifes name again
she is in elvis and annabelle have you ever seen that	no what is that about
theres also the mortal kombat movie series	series there was more than one
have you bought sgt peppers 50th anniversary album yet	noive heard and read a lot about it though
i saw cleveland and baltimore in the playoffs  johnny unitas  was the quarterback	that was a long while ago
and sandy looks amazing in the black leather	she totally does
yeah those two were alright but just too much computer animation in all of them	i agree they didnt look anything like the original films

are you a beatles fan	i was a huge fan in the 60s and i listened to their albums over and over memorizing every word
who was the first player in baseball history to hit more than 25 home runs in a season	that would be ned williamson who played for the chicago white stockings in 1884 his 27 home runs along with his teams 142 total home runs was a fluke
i think this would lead to more injuries but if it didnt i wouldnt mind adding two more games and bye weeks so the season would be 18 games and 3 byes	see i dont think we will see that much of an additional injury impact just because there is already a lot of injuries you also have guys returning from injuries that were experienced early on you always see that plus the age old football motto of next man up will be more important than ever
i love how she wears her makeup too so dark and gorgeous	same here eyeliner always on point
i think i read that they thought its be cut post production so they just kept playing	ah well that makes a lot of sense then

yeah i think you have to wait 25 years from a first record release	they definitely satisfy that requirement
i agree you can never hear the singer	im not even sure why the music teacher allows that
i like obi wan a lot too although he is responsible for helping train darth vadar	ya thats a good point he didnt always make the best choices
it doesnt matter its just robots beating the crap out of each other	which is part of what makes it unwatchable we dont know whats happening and with whom
did you see them all	no i only saw fellowship of the ring and the two towers
haha thats amazing	the only other award show i watched was the grammys
i agree	he has some great beats in his songs
lando isnt loyal though he betrayed han and his friends	thats true but if he didnt leia would never had said she loved him
yeah hes all class and he obviously has a proven record as a good director	i just hope the movie turns out okay in the end

i think rogue one was sort of cookie cutter	how was it cookie cutter

what line was that	he said i love the smell of napalm in the morning
well i can if you want	nah
when that song first came out it blew up and became an instant classic	yes it did
hahaha alright sure that would be of if theres still time we could watch fist fight saw it half way at anns parents	oh i see i guessed right then i knew youll love ghetto films and with ice cube on it is easy to tell it would be nice
who do we blame for that	i kind of blame puff daddy and people like will smith who made hip hop too popish

i think it helps them not get as injured as much	yeah the older ones get hurt more

yep ive tried to get into it a little or at least see what she sees in it	and how has that gone
i didnt know that	i do its annoying some of the songs are ok but thats it

lady gagas new song perfect illusion just came on the radio again on the way home	i finally heard it
i think joe namath would be worth a lot	i loved him
we heard that too	my son watched it years ago and loved it
oh wow then is a definitely a must see what about anger management that sounds serious	it´s actually not it´s super funny it deals whit someone that is tricked to join anger management so he can overcome some issues but in the movie jack makes his life impossible
yeah great choice	what about you
now beyonce kinda took control of it	beyonce has the crown now
yeah i agree they are in a major rebuild	what do you think is most important to do to rebuild the franchise
thats just it it was a tiny station with a wide variety of old obscure records lying around	theyd just reach over and grab something to fill the airtime
yes it was about the prisoner who escaped	that movie was so good i have not read the book though
they do take away from her prettiness	i wish they could see that
so kids movies	thats what i prefer in the halloween genre
you think its going to be fitzgeralds last year	i dont know he seems to be superhuman he may last forever what do you think
that is why they call them protagonists and antagonists but yeah they are the good guys they are not murderers like her they work to uphold the law	would they be working to uphold the law if they were not getting paid for it
ryan reynolds betty white and a bunch of other actors i know but not their names	no i dont think so
what about the due groups from the 60s who was your favorite	i would say the everly brothers
i feel like they are just one cliche after another	i dont think so i think it is a fun song and he really probably likes all those things
at least in the straightforward way in which he does it	exactly
yeah so i guess i might still be at the starting line	i mean youre picking nfl players who do you think will do well
they have a good coach	he has been there a long time
oh yeah what is that	they play old music centered around a theme
we should buy tickets for her show	sounds like a plan
mat damon stars in this one  he tries to find his true identity despite people trying to kill him	it is always enjoyable to watch matt damon act in the bourne series
what period	the 60s you get what that was
it would be quite different	i do not think it would be good
that a director of his caliber can churn our mediocre films	yes and it also makes me feel now that the alien franchise has become a caricature of what it used to be
anthony perkins was creepy in psycho	janet leigh was great too
you should watch it it was really good in my opinion	i will do that anything with jackson in it will most likely be pretty entertaining
who is the 49ers quarterback this year	i think it is brian hoyer its amazing how colin kaepernick isnt even playing on any team this year when he used to be quite the player
yes i cant stop listening to it	me too whats your favorite song on it
did you ever take a music cruise	oh yeah through cayamo theres others too
whats your favorite scene from star wars	the light saber fight between darth vadar and obi one is classic
they were a good band they had a unique sound	they definitely were a good band they kind of had a 1940s sounding style combined with a punk rock vibe
who is your team	minnesota baby all day
no its so different i swear	what kind of music is it
thats really sad the only good part of that is for that rare movie that really is special it totally stands out from the rest	uhhuh whats your most recent example of something like that
once i went to hear the symphony orchestra and the male cellist dressed as princess leia	really  how did he look
well they can use some more streamlining	what do you mean
that is true  giants and mets met in the playoffs last season and this year they both look like theyve regressed	well the mets had a really promising pitching rotation  but injuries have really hurt them
me too i loved him in the sixth sense	m night shymalan directed the sixth sense unbreakable and split
then they moved to arlington	i liked it when tom landry was their coach
do you think we need a good sports comedy	you mean like
lebron james will probably get it though	when will the award be announced
they were always a group that would add to your depression	you got that right
what what was your favorite sharks game ever played	i would say in 2010 when they played against the red wings i loved how marleau and thornton rescued the game
are you a jonas brothers fan	i loved their old music
he could make me cry just watching him	he can make me cry just listening to him
we bought the dvd because we like his work but then sold it on ebay	so it was that bad
as i got older i went to a few movies at the drive in movie  i remember seeing two lane blacktop there all the gear heads were there and revving up their engines  ha ha	i remember going on a few dates at the movies  the first one was with a girl and we saw i think charlottes web  it was pretty nice
i dont remember any	cant think of all of them off the top of my head but he did

agreed  her music is good to workout too	yep  like you said before her music is good enough but her persona and antics are her drawback  i guess it is what she had to do to get noticed
cool same here	nice
what do you think of todays rock music	not much of anything new i like
i wonder if they ever thought of making a sequel to that movie	sequels are never as good as the first movie maybe thats why they didnt do it

looks that kill of course	me too that was a great album
yeah talk about selling out	come on man pay me enough and ill sing celine dion on the next cable guy movie

yes and those songs are still good now	some rock songs always will be
is that from the new album	yeah it is i just heard it and i thought it was great
yep think the highest amongst the qbs is ryan fitzpatrick with 48 which 2 points below perfect score	why do the nfl use it anyway what does it even test
alright i will pick a winner it is just really hard i think i am going to go with the warriors they just have to many weapons for anyone to deal with	yea having just durant and curry would make any team special however adding draymond green and klay thompson makes them almost unbeatable
that makes sense	maybe one day if youre being nice ill go see one with you
you never know they might have pulled a milli vanilli	wow i havent heard that name in like twenty years
i like edward norton hes always great	yeah he hasnt been in anything quite as good as american history x or fight club though

have you thought about what the bridesmaids will be wearing	oh yeah since the guys are wearing soft gray suits i was thinking of having the girls wear tiffany blue
yea	i dont listen to him that much
well they wear gloves but still i think it hurts too	plus they are running as fast as they can the timing to catch the ball is amaing
what songs are you referring to by kenny rogers	lady the gambler weve got tonight and of course his version of i will always love you
sounds good i dont like classic too much personally though	what type of music do you like then

thats true	i thought they made the beast look great

i shall until next time	maybe next time we will go for someluther

yes where have you been	i know im too busy to pay attention to this stuff
i cant believe it went into extra innings	yea the bullpens pitched great though
yeah man hes good	it had on the edge of my seat
not yet just seen it on tv	hopefully i wont see it anywhere else
do you know who they are up against	i think the ne pats
and thats why they dropped her off on jakku	it also explains the crap she found me look on lukes face at the end of vii
what were some of your favorite tv shows growing up	oh man thats a loaded question lots of answers
yes and so was an old fashioned love song	didnt paul williams write that
i listened to it a few times they sound like old green day	like very grungey

please they are going to win it all again this year	never happen their pitching isnt good enough
yea they both have good young quarterbacks	yea but one may not actually be good
who do you wanna see in concert	kanye west
sadly with jackman retiring from wolverine that wont happen	i know  it makes me sad
well fair point but mulans story still seems more grounded in reality	it is  and thats what is amazing about it  it is so much more human than a story like the lion king
it has actually made him iconic in the industry	would he have been iconic without the hat
its tough to beat teams that have won before when it gets to crunch time	yea there is something to be said about knowing how to win
the one that plays wonder woman	oh gal gadot i think
yes exactly it seemed like there was a period of time around there were race was not a big deal sexuality was not a big deal and people got a long much better	okay i see what your saying now yes i totally agree
have you seen the jennifer lawrence dior handbag ad	im not sure is that the one where she is wearing a white sweater
did you see the disney movie cinderella	of course hasnt everyone
bour gordan even ichiro	they may have to hire a new batting coach what happened to barry bonds
it bothers me even more because brady looks like he is getting better with age	i thought he was joking when he said he wants to play until hes 50 but honestly hes making me a believer year by year
it was late 1979 i remember because that was the year i first heard foxys get off	is that the same year the rap record dont push me cause im close to the edge came out
like when harry met sally	yes i love that one
i dont really like his lyrics too much is like he raps on the 8th grade level	youre funny his raps are a little mature
do you like scary moves my all time favorite scary movie has to be the original amityville horror	absolutley that house was crazy i couldnt imagine living there it looks creepy to begin with
no the live action one	what did you think of the movie
oh why do you say that	lennon said it was about his daughters drawing
it was kind of like that there was a lot of screaming so i guess you could say that	was it any good

i havent heard bbtm but ive heard starboy and i think its great	honestly i love all his music
yes i like her voice	shes talented
lordes new album	god yes
im sure they could retcon most of the princess movies into the same world one way or another	why are you doing this why is this a thing you need to think about
do you have somebody that you like a lot now	i like anderson paak a lot right now
is a real boy is their second best	no way that was a rock opera and clearly their finest work
if you had to pick what would be your favorite movie of all time	wow bad question i have a few
yes that is exactly my point	i also like to see an artist evolve
have you heard the new incubus album	i havent is it any good
exactly  you can create your own version of the story apart from everyone elses	i really like that  to me it seems as if doing that can stir up really interesting conversations within a group of fans

no way	apparently it started in the new york club scene
that is a great song i miss that	do you have any albums of hers

i have seen the one actor who played gordon once in a while on tv	i think i had noticed him on law and order

how do you like the last disney movie	i really liked it
have you seen the star wars movies	did you really just ask that question
is that the backstreet boys	no i think it is in sync
it seems like weve been saying that for a while now	i know  the problem is they havent all been healthy and ready to play at the same time
free throw shooting is terrible in the league anymore	why do you think that happened
but yoda had an excuse he was really old and on his last legs he also lost when he fought palpatine and originally he wasnt even supposed to be a fighter	luke doesnt have those excuses does he maybe snoke did beat him
youve seriously never heard of public enemy	no man i dont think so
no i know its christopher nolan though	thats my favorite of his
the raiders seem like the team to beat	i was surprised when they added lynch
i agree and  i like how it gave way to more sequels but then again 7 was enough	8 if you count rogue one
yea since i was born	me too
popular but annoying  i get it	i would also put adam beyer up there as well  he just plays trash
the characters were much more likeable in treasure planet	there were evil characters in both movies you cant base it off of that
i could see how youd feel that way i think its just meant to be party music	a lot of rap is going in that direction i like rap for the lyrics though
well look even the soundbite disney uses at the start of ilms is from pinnochio isnt it	i think so i believe it is when you wish upon a star
oh well i for one like bell bottoms	you can keep them
i like a few songs by them but i like little mix better	i get that
i agree	hard work is important and drive
yeah but she dresses awfully weird did you see those outfits she was wearing in the video they were showing	thats just how lady gaga dresses she would not be herself if she didnt she never looked too bad she never does

how about the linebacker spot	james harrison is back again and even at his age he still plays well
do you have a favorite team	dallas cowboys baby
this new coach is suppose to be promising	yeah i heard he is one the rare coaches to win five hundred games before he reached age fifty
i also tried to win bruno mars ticket	i have bruno mars song thats what i like as my ring tone
yeah but somehow she makes it work she speeds up and slows down to make up for it	sounds like it gets funny how often does she write music
yeah i especially enjoyed the commercial for the 6000sux	that was a good one did you think they made good use of violence
have you seen a fast and furious movie	yeah i think ive seen them all except for the newest one that is out now
what was the last movie you saw	300
the weird part is they had the seeds for tying this together in keatons girlfriend who is tied to the man that can identify him	ah i forgot about edie but im guessing that maybe soze just pulled all of this off because he had no other choice
i´ll give it a try then any famous actors on the movie	yes the main character her real name is karla souza i believe she is a famous mexican actress
i wonder what frozen 2 will be about	maybe their children

yeah they really have a difficult time with new england	dont remind me
you wont be disappointed	great
same whats your favorite song	probably two ghosts its so emotionally charged and lyrically beautiful
hi there	hello there

sissy spacek and martin sheen starred in badlands	what was badlands about
if he would just be postseason joe all season long	absolutely hes a beast in the playoffs
yea i really loved those movies	the special effect style of the fight choreography was very original
yeah it didnt make sense there  i dont get why you liked it better in it	pretty much nothing in that movie made sense  that actually was one of the parts i liked
hello bro what is up with you	nothing much
do you think this version of the hulk will get his own movie	probably not i think every one would just be done too many versions
milsap is got to be their top priority	indeed he is their best player

the first album that adults also listen to	i think it was billy joel we didnt start the fire

no if i do its not usually by choice	the classic take is that hes a much better businessman than a rapper
han solo or greedo	still confused
really why tom over peyton	peyton is great but he isnt clutch
do you think the fast and the furious is still relevant	there are really just a lot of them
it would be difficult to make a bad movie with actors like that	and robert deniro is in the godfather 2 but i havent seen it

true although i really liked john travoltas performance in that film	to be honest with the exception of martin lawrence all of the performances in that movie were very forgettable
its by the beatles its called something	is it by paul or john
ill admit its very weird to hear that	i just feel she is on a pedestal that she really shouldnt be on let alone let herself be on
it was cute how they ended up together	i know i like movies i like that
he was on love and hip hop for a while	i guess so his rap career wasnt too tight

yeah me too i was watching a program last night and they were saying jordan couldnt win until bird and magic declined	i honestly never understood this reasoning its like saying kobe wouldnt have won if prime jordan was still playing
he went downhill once he got involved with a reality star	i slightly agree in terms of his ego but his music is still good
well theres always been good and bad music i guess  i like what they play on kisn its popular and the kids like it	you know ive seen some new acts lately watching darrells house on mtv
mia farrow was well cast in it	she looks innocent so that is a good contrast with the evilness
yeah maybe more popular with women but a solid choice	i just love how all the abba songs propel the story line and are not just random
thats true there was nothing really like it at the time	after them there were a lot of copycats
well hes the basquiat of rap culture he knows no bounds	you should write for his magazine youve got a way with words
cool i would like to	you should great show
how did they sound live	you know the same as any album
i love him i dont remember that album though	its his best one in my opinion

the spice girls were my favorite pop group	mine too i love so many of their songs
i think that uptown girl is one of her favorites	that is a great song i love that track
oh really they arent that good either	but in my case they are better than the royals
meaning what	well like it seemed more innocent before  though some music is still like that i suppose
i dont think the cavs ever took the celtics seriously	i dont believe they did either
in the video for this song the last fight	oh i havent seen the video yet
yes i didnt know she had blonde hair at first	she does wear a lot of different color hair

i think you totally should all of the actors were great	i bet
hes a running back	oh yeah now i remember yeah he is good
you have yourself a deal that will certainly be an event	yeah one of those releases that is worth the extra cash on pedigree alone

hes underrated	i see now
their song this is all yours was an instant hit in the uk	i will check that one out as well
oh you really like westerns	yes i do how about the searchers its a john wayne classic with a marvelous character played perfectly
he did direct both john wick movies and he did v for vendetta but he was also a stunt man	i have not seen any of his movies then
mine to	how long does it take for that to happen
you dont see how thats bad	to each their own
seriously i love it its so original	i guess thats one way to put it
i think scfi movies have really changed in recent years	they are more focused on making them more real i think  like they could happen unlike stuff like the matrix
the hafltime show is always the highlight at least for me	the halftime show is great but it shouldnt be your highlight
i knew that something bad would need to happen to shake up the story but i wasnt expecting the death	and how much it shook up maverick  that brought it home to me
its okay	are most of the songs good
nah  they should have stuck with clooney as he makes the perfect playboy	the best batman will always be christian bale

he was great from the beginning	i loved the jackson 5 as well

so what do you think of hip hop right now	its a love hate right now
have you heard about the drama surrounding the new han solo movie	no i havent what happened
i loved the last scene where they sort of did an homage to paul	do you mean where dom went to race him one last time
so true	i liked the bangles
ive had more success following established artists on social media and then looking up who they advertise than i do searching on my own	i may have to try that
yeah its like a credit score for honesty thats all over your face	would the growth be proportionate to the lie

he always wore that eye patch he was a character wasnt he	yes he was i cant remember who all was in that band can you

well dramatic situation usually have so much emotion involved leads to a good moving performance	ya it plays on peoples emotion like sympathy
i sure will	i especially like rolling in the deep
well yes of course you know i only go check out the scariest ones it was staring jared p elisha cand a few other famous actors i like	in the beginning of the movie a car load of friends get a flat tire and they end up in a ghost town they are forced to stop at a wax museum and this turns out to be almost as worse as a night mare on elm street
have you seen cars 3 yet	no i hadnt realized it was coming out so soon
who is your favorite character in the star wars universe	i really like han solo harrison ford is a good actor and solo has those rogueish qualities that i really like
he is one of the main characters as well so if you like him you will be pleased	awesome thanks for the info
they should still win the division though i think they get to 1012 wins	yes i can see that the cardinals are the only real competition in the division
that song he did with mia a few years ago was really good i think it was called xxxo	i liked that album but i really preferred his old stuff like hard knock life
yeah maybe he was doing that to be more fair or hes a prick and was showing off	a bit of both id say he could have easily hit 50 over the pitifullyshort right field walls
well pittsburgh is still involved	i dont know if they can sustain it against ottawa
ill have to check it out	you will love them
any genres that you like in particular	i like a whole bunch of different kinds of things  different genres

trent knows how to play the market plus you never know with nin	yeah remember the slip came out of nowhere overnight
winning environment people will take a discount to win titles	yeah i guess so
what kind of reasons can you be more specific	well i like camelot because i love the story of king arthur and although its a little odd for knights to be singing it really tells the story well
no im pretty sure no one else in the cast really went on to be a big star	didnt they make a bunch of sequels
it really is thats half the reason i like it right there	jimmy stewart was in more than one hitchcock film as i recall
the cavaliers are much better than the celtics	yes that is true

have you seen a cinderella story	is that the one with hillary duff
i hope their is another	i know

i thought they did a lot of good with rey in the force awakens i hope they continue with her in the new movie	i cant wait to see all of our favorite characters together again in the last jedi
roberts stars as an abused wife who goes on the run in search of a better life	this sounds like a movie that i am going to enjoy
the ending scene when they are climbing the mountain into switzerland is pretty moving	yes i think the real life von trapp family had to escape austria in a similar fashion
i did	was it good
what a movie	what a great part he played
thats no fun to drink alone	sometimes its best to just let it all out
ive always liked the packers	who do you think is a better quarterback tom brady or aaron rodgers
i agree bigger audience	that and they need to do every other day
i mean why not  cap survived	and the red skull is just like him only evil

thats not an easy schedule	no its not
how so	well a lot of what rap is about is speaking the truth and saying it in a public way
about 3 or 4 months ago	oh the one i said i think it was going to be a different kind of movie
one of my favorite parts of star wars is when luke goes to dagobah to train with yoda	that is a great little storyline
a lot of foreign people really hate it because they think it mocks their culture and is an improper representation of foreigners	thats what makes it so funny though i feel like if you cant enjoy it for its humor you are just stuck up

she has a beautiful voice very ethereal	i really like her harmonies and the layered voices she uses in her recordings
there or anywhere really  netflix hulu etc	hmm let me think
what else did tim burton do	edward scissorhands
i know and since then shes dueted with tony bennett and has become almost too normal	i agree i think her songwriting is strong enough to stand on its own but i gravitate more to songs that arent really straightforward
to each their own	yup
what about you	i like a lot of edm techno drum and bass that kind of thing

i still like most of their music even though some remind me of my ex now	like which songs do you mean
i love to watch old school star wars movies how about you	yes the new ones are just not as good

if you have not seen cabin in the woods yet stop and go watch it	i saw it joss whedon did great

yeah i think the old actors sold the first original movie	plus i just didnt care for the story or setting

what do you want to do this weekend	maybe we could go to the movies
i couldnt agree with you more	i think this seasons playoff will be very interesting

yeah definitely	you cant be serious
yeah really i mean eight losses	what strategies do you think he needs to employ
who had the best dress at the met ball	i wouldnt say it was the best but i think rhianna had the most interesting outfit the texture and color was pretty and crazy at the same time
but thats all based on conjecture isnt it	the entire draft is predicated on that
really  more so than no i am your father	okay perhaps you have a point  that is the quintessential star wars line
whats that mean	it means your best creation during your career your standout

i love the whole abbey road album	come on choose a song
i knew youd know the song whats it called	its by yg hes even featured drake in it
absolutely right they dont put anything on for the cameras its all real and as it happens	i cant believe ive never heard of it before im going to download the first episode right now
definitely the motorcycle and truck chase between arnold schwarzenegger and the t1000	thats my favorite too probably one of the greatest chases in history period
tim allen stars in the movie also i wonder who produces them	i am unsure who produces the others but i know this one galyn susman produced it
its got some great music in it too	like what
do you think that the hard cap in the nfl has helped the nfl	no doubt look at its popularity

yes a little bit similar flow to hopsin but his own touch to rapping	what are some other songs
so why are you wearing heels then	because they match my kilt
it is what other purpose does it serve	its believed to have been made to inspire children to do great things
damn man	whats up
i thought they were great a good mix of old and new stuff	a bit too selfindulgent for my liking who plays pulkpull if they want to have a good time
absolutely who wouldnt love and enjoy aliens that invade earth that look like clowns	why would any body make something so stupid
okay buddy	get away from me

yeah	well at the main climax of the song they sing the original german lyrics
yeah hes not as good as he used to be	right  i cringed watching most of the games last season
which is your favorite movie from the marvel ones	i would have to say all the wolverine series specially the last one logan

well he doesnt need motivation right	i got ya
do you like the whole idea of remaking films with allfemale cast members	i think thats very interesting i do like to see a new take on my favorite movies

i heard christian bale played thomas	i didnt know that but i did know mel gibson played john smith
hey mom what is a good movie	honey im busy go watch alice through the looking glass
exactly so the little mermaid has been overshadowed for me	that makes a lot of sense
it comes on starz this weekend	ill have to rewatch it
but what im also saying is i didnt think they needed to exist and both sequels were great films	thats very true its hard to distrust disney and pixar at this point
and their album is out soon right	yes on june 16
who is your team by the way	im a browns fan
i dont know i think the cardinals will be very good this season	yeah but carson palmer fell off last year if you dont have a good qb its hard to be good
well he took out a knife and she started freaking out so she figured ill either get raped or ill drive off this cliff	oh and she chose the cliff

i liked that one too but isnt it old	yes it is a classic but the classics are the best
how about that young talent on the sixers	yea but embiid cant stay healthy
true but there are a lot of factors involved with their performance on the field	i dont think joe girardi is a very good manager though thats just my opinion
do you know who halsey is	kind of shes from the chainsmokers right
how do you feel about the patriots as an organization	i love their consistency but i hate their individual parts
would you ever sell it	if i was to get a new one perhaps
yeah i thought he was really good but its hard to beat ricardo montalbans potrayal	oh yeah that guy was great wasnt he on fantasy island as well
a lot of quality teams in this division some seem to be on the precipice of being powerhouses	i dont know about powerhouses but there are a few teams that should be really good
yeah thats the one	that movie is pretty funny
but yeah did i leave my priest cds over their	i am not sure i can look though for you

it was a little creepy and funny	yes it was

do you think the new spiderman will be any good	i think it could be
his lyrics are also really metaphorical	hes also hilarious
i love them too	we should go to a concert
yeah trying to make superman dark was just completely the wrong call	after the dark knights success they kinda thought everything had to go that route
prayer and maybe some wizardry they are going to eat our oline alive	i hope eli worked on his agility drills this summer because hes going to be doing a lot of running that game
yes it was a scary movie part 2 is coming to theaters soon	is part 2 scary too
he is and the actress that voices the main character moana is hawaiian	how did they do with capturing the visuals of the scenery
so what did you think of  rogue one	i dont know i didnt really like the beginning at all
unfortunately no nowadays movies are more difficult to make so studios are less likely to make movies not based on popular source material	that would explain the proliferation in comic book movies over the past decade
yeah they played it for a long time	thats something else i dont like about pop music you hear the same stuff over and over again and you memorize every note
i know his best tracks	which ones are they
odell and victor have to play well	yup not even sure who their running back is
thats right he was pretty good	yeah had some good position players too
so things like techno music and all its many many offshoots are very funky	but their fans wont really identify it as such
what so you mean	do you remember when we had movie after movie about an asteroid or meteor hitting the earth
no its so much better than him	im agreeing with you i love aaron burrs voice the most
have you ever seen the movie black water	no ive never heard of it whats it about

you never saw it	no
yeah i did but that didnt fix it  i dunno if its true or not but i read someone that sony dvds are real sensitive to scratches  supposedly if id bought a 50 cheap dvd player i wouldnt have that problem	i assuming you mean 50 was cheap for when you first bought your player because you can dvd players for like 25 nowdays
do you still like the song now	yes i like radiohead but i havent really heard a lot of their new stuff
sometimes the simplicity is nice though	yeah i can understand that
did you think the movie was scary	i thought it was really scary at the end of the movie
wasnt that detroit hail mary for the division title though or seeding purposes	it was we ended up improving our record and seeding but then lost to  arizona that year in the playoffs
yes it proved that math was more than just numbers	i agree that it changed the way numbers are seen and inspires you to look at numbers differently
for real	just sitting here
they are my team	ever been to a game
this means we have to get jerseys and pick a new favorite player	then so be it we finally have a legitimate football team
cool i feel like her films can be sort of hit or miss but i think ill give this film a try	its also interesting because apparently colin farrell is the only male actor in the film really
right so it sounded silly	i agree that he should have kept his focus around rap
dont forget to look up glen phillips too	oh thats right  who knows if hes putting anything out
yes not those in the original trilogy	i thought episode iii return of the sith was the best one
what year did they do that reunion thing	1994 and then officially reformed in 2002
i think it helped peter be more confident	peter is very confident with his powers he could not shoot a web once and might have died
i dont know the lyrics	you dont know the music neither
elvis almost portrayed himself in that movie a young and upcoming rock star who would know	i think im going to pull the elvis vinyl records i have from storage and donate them you for your museum

he did indeed	do you know any famous jazz groups
lets talk about star wars movies	sounds great

yeah its been nothing new for them to dominate defensively	i have to say the texans are looking really strong defensively too
my  husband used to be in a 311 tribute band so he is playing live in the living room right now while hes listening to a video playlist on tv	how cool that would make it a gazilion times better to hear it live
i can not believe it was that long	how can it possibly take that long i do not understand
i just found this playlist of throwback hits from when we were in high school	wow whats on it
do you like fashion	yes i love fashion
it sounds like something you would like i need a faster beat	it helps me relax after a day at work
well i guess i can see your point they have no respect for their coach	i used to really like marvin lewis but he just cant get it done
mr 3000 wasnt that good	ok but little giants was
this story speaks of the bravery that has the chinese girl	of course going to war and posing as a man

ugh im so tired of the patriots winning everything	tom brady forever baby
who is your favorite band	i really love metallica
did you see alladdin	you mean the cartoon
so do you think the nfl should do more to protect players from injuries	i think they should always be pushing for that but you also have to realize that everyone involved with football knows how dangerous it is
pharrell had wrote it for ceelo green	really what happened
were supposed to talk about movies right	right
i think nauty by nature and a few other rap groups be there next wek a 5pm	thanks alot you know how i love my ole school rap
do you know that the lion king was essentially hamlet right	was it now i did not know that

a lot of people really like her	she puts out some really great music
it was a good kids movies	reminded me of napolean dynmaite

i recently watched nice guys and really enjoyed it	is that the one where he plays a private detective
did you see the trailer for the new deadpool movie	it looks like it will be really good

do you like pulp fiction	i love it i love crazy and interesting movies
it was based on the arabstyle folktale aladdin and the magic lamp	the genie in aladdin was very funny

like who	stuff like motley crue poison and the others
that was last season	dude this year theyve added some weapons
thats interesting what do they sound like	some songs are very different from others
yeah when everybody does it it becomes uncool	indeed  my daughter still loves all these songs though
like nickel creek mumford and sons a little bit lake street dive stuff like that	and did you like the concert last night
they should get more female referees and coaches as well	for sure women know just as much about the game these days
yes his company donated 100000 to the city	wow i will watch it again it was a great movie
were there others	yes there were at least three others
did you see the latest spiderman trailer yet	yes i just saw it last night
the action suspense and dialouge is flawless but not quiet as quotable as pulp fiction	not a very quotable movie but it has some of the most tense scenes it is top 2 with reservoir dogs for me
i think julia roberts is a feast for the eyes personally but they trapped her in that horrible outfit they didnt even dress her like the classic disney tinkerbell	yeah that was a miss on their parts they made up for it a little bit in the sequence where tinkerbell becomes as big as peter to confess her feelings for him
who had the most assists on carolinas team	justin jackson had 4 assists
the lead singer is incredible and talented too	what is his name
without jim carrey though	that makes little to no sense
oh i see have you gone to any good rock concerts lately	no actually i havent but i want to dough
oh yeah  i just googled it	and britney has her own vegas show drop the mike
do you know anything about mumblecore movies	surprisingly a bit
but i think i heard he runs like a 44 forty	thats pretty good faster than a lot of qbs
he was really good he won four superbowls in a six year period	my dad has always said he was the best quarterback ever
he reminds me of another bears possession wr marty booker	oh yeah he was on probably one of the worst 133 teams i can ever remember jim miller was the qb

that was a film with nearly perfect casting	i thought even orlando bloom did so well as the elf
do you enjoy disney movies	oh yes i do for sure my favorite is the lion king
who is your favorite actress	i would have to say nicole kidman
well it is three hours long so not an easy watch	i remember when that came out  hard to believe its been 20 years
which one of the two is your favorite	green bay
an older one that is great is i got some help i dont need	i dont think i have ever heard that one
come on youve probably heard of them before	no im serious i havent
i think the black belt reminds me too much of a kids dress	really i think its a really good accent and allows the bottom of the dress to flare nicely
the second saddest was when anakin kills a bunch of kid jedis	right bad
thats it  so upbeat  i cant help but dance	i love carrie underwood  her music really speaks to me
i understand doing it on an album but not live	i especially dont like it for the voice of the singer
definitely which one should be first	lets go with last friday night
did you get to see arrival yet	yea we watched​ that the other day it was during the day because i was scared
yeah it was good but not as good as the remake i dont think  i thought the second was scarier	probably because of the special effects
i cant wait for the upcoming season the pats have a scrimmage in just about two weeks	i think it is against the saints
something i feel that modern artists do not do	yes and that is not good
doesnt he have a kid or something too	yeah i wonder what his name is and what he is up to now
indeed the movie has a great balance of characters	yeah and were even forgetting the best of all can you guess it
are you looking forward to seeing wonder woman	i am it looks fun and action packed
they also sell it in alot of stores	that is were i get most of mine
you are right	i am going to go home at watch it
there really werent a whole lot of songs in that movie though  at least not compared to some of the movies	i wonder if it will be the same storyline and if they will have mushu
oh that could be very interesting what are the names of the two main actors from split	the main guy is james mcavoy and the girl is anya taylorjoy
well i suppose we will agree to disagree	yes definitely i am glad we each found something to like in the film at least
lightsabers	yes we know theyre not possible and if they were real youd melt your own body off
do you know who the devils are playing tonight	i am not sure why
she was really great in the 90s	i dont really like her newer stuff
they still hurt and i have rotator cuff issues you	no injuries for me luckily sorry about your experiences
i agree they are always epic and they tell a story	yeah shes definitely one of the few true talented artists out there today
yes they are really confusing the old ones the new ones the newer new ones	well i would watch them how they were made to be watched in order of release the way the plot plays favors that order
its surprising to me i havent heard it at the climax of a hollywood blockbuster movie	dont jinx it
i was in stitches the entire time	that good huh
on my way to work the song i will always love you by whitney houston was on the radio i love that song	you mean by dolly parton
i like her song bad romance	shes too wierd for me
i wouldnt be surprised if it wasnt	i dont think it is but i could be wrong
omg that was the craziest movie i had ever seen in those days	yes it was an original to say the least
i like jessicas dress better its more fitted and gives a lot more shape than andies dress	but the black belt on andies really ties the whole dress together
how about dramas you go for them	i like big sweeping epics
i never heard of them	i know one of them looks a lot like john
how can you choose just one song	well what if you had to what would you pick
i wish he lived to play in the rest he would make them much better	definitely he would
i liked it	i was scared the whole album would be like that
plus the battle scenes were the best youve ever seen	yes  it was crazy the slow then fast fighting
now i remember sador but i feel ive seen him somewhere before the actor i mean	ever watch enter the dragon
its a very messed up movie but does he do any other kind	that is true what are they doing though
yea well they some how seem to make the right trades and just moves in general	yea they clearly know how to build a team
well what about nightmare on elm street or friday the 13th	im not a big horror movie buff i actually havent seen either
do you think him and sammy sosa should be in the hall of fame	of course they should  everyone in baseball is on steroids
i saw a video of them playing the national anthem on a piano with one keyone key	radical
he did judd apatow has his hand in so many great comedies	at this point he must have made a lot of money from those movies
yes it did when they were at the party dom was like busta id the only one that kept me outta cuffs that was great	i really should watch the first one again its been so long
because i´m critical of movies and even though i liked it some parts did not looked very real	oh i see dont worry then i will see it this weekend
what is nell like	very different from monroes other characters she is a young woman who was just released from the mental hospital after attempting suicide because her husband was lost overseas during world war two
well actually it is hard there is alot of split rational deiciosn you havbe tomake in terms of which way to run how to cut when to cut	huh i wouldve never thought of football as a decision making process
you should youd like them	you usually like good stuff
do you remember the all girl group en vogue	yeah they were really good in the late 90s

its called i dont want to live forever	oh is it any good
i will send you my top 25 to listen to	sounds good thanks
i loved it  although i have to admit i had no idea it was her at first	yeah her new sound showcases her voice a lot more
i dont think so but whatever man	but i will confess that if  and thats a big if all your steelers can stay healthy an not suspended they should stay on top
theyre always off beat	true thats why theyre so good
want to go to the movies	sure
well if they want to keep it realistic as least to some extent the terminator shouldnt age right	of course even now if you compare him in the first movie and in the last theres a big difference
are you a fan of marilyn manson	not really but his version would just better
well im surprised you havent heard his new one  its been a billboard number one song for twenty weeks	wow on which billboard list
listen to this song its called lady brown some guy named cise star sings the lyrics	insane crazy rhythm and am loving the lyrics it flows so smoothly
and pointless thats why i stopped watching	have you seen the haunting
it was released november 13 2015	who produced it
the old school song i like from them the best is is this the end	thats a beautiful song ralph trezvant had such a sweet voice
regardless i still think you should give rogue one a chance its a lot better as a stand alone movie	were the reviews good

whats your favorite song from the lala land soundtrack	city of stars
me too	the genie is my favorite part
sure the duke was one of the greatest of all time and clint eastwood sure had a good run of it	who could forget his run with the dirty harry series where he was the tough cop rogue who always took out the worst criminals
it was cool how they connected that movie with the other marvel ones	yeah shield was in the other ones
im not a fanboy but i liked the song heathens	you knownot bad for a pop song
he puts it all on the field regardless if he is injured or his line is porous	i cant agree with that now we have reports about sherman

me too	bye
it wasnt one of his finer moments	but still it was kurt right
i think thats evident	i do not know what they are going to do
do you play nfl madden	i used to quite a bit but since i have kids now its a lot tougher but i miss it  i grew up playing tecmo bowl for nes
i love one  x	ill give it a shot
and two guitarists who also sing and play synths	nice
i guess i can see that but how they are going to tie this new one into that	its pretty clear cut that weyland yutani knew for quite some time that there was something on that planet that they wanted
i was catcher	oh cool
then what is the correct answer	slayer is the correct answer
thats one of my favorite things about rap	i guess its my only favorite  i just like good loud beats

have you seen the new wonder women movie	no is it any good
what happened to it	it merged with the nfl in 1969
you absolutely must i will even grab a ticket for you if they play nearby	thanks a lot man i really appreciate it
i think it was even scarier because it was based on a true story	kind of like that scary movie annabellethe one with the doll
i like the actors	whos in it
what music does he enjoy	he likes heavy metal songs from scandinavia and electronic music
try me i bet ive heard of them	well meshuggah is another fave
i think then you go to almost science fiction	no it was a horror movie and it worked right into what the movie should have been
oh yeah totally	but its definitely necessary to make the movie more interesting
are you kidding me right she is one of the best singers out here her best album was emanicipation of mimi	what songs are on those album
the child shes supposed to take care of is actually a doll  the boy was in a fire and the parents treat the doll like their lost son	really  that doesnt sound all that scaryjust strange and sad
what specific examples do you have to support that idea	well for instance take care was a great album but all his songs are too focused on how the women of his life shaped him
do you know that he sold over 115 million albums during his careet	i did not know that
i dont remember seeing many scraps at the minor league park  it was close a couple times and both benches cleared but the umps got it under control in time	i dont remember seeing any fights at the yankee games  just in the parking lot when everyone tried to leave at the same time
they were all over new england	its like new england had no answer
and now theyre all dead	you are truly a buzzkill
they had just about the same number of hits i think bye bye bye is my favorite nsync track	its so nostalgic to think about those songs i still pull up the music videos from time to time and they just bring a smile to my face
his orchestral suite number 1	ok obviously dont know it
well i like classic gangster movies and film noir	me too what is you favorite  i love desert fury with elizabeth scott but i also like really trashy 60s movies like peyton place
of course the beatles are one of the best bands of all time	i am suprised you didnt mention them
ha the one where big bird runs away	well he gets adopted by the dodos and runaway back home to sesame street
happy feet that movie came out 11 years ago why havent you watched it yet	hey i also have a busy social life too i cant just watch every movie that comes out
can you imagine having our children ripped from us to go hunt each other	that is a really crazy thing but i bet there are some countries whose children have to fight to survive
are you ready for nfl	yes favorite time of the year
can you believe gaga ever had a weight issue	it is hard to believe she looks so petite
i was watching cars the other night my favorite is still sally	im more partial to doc that scene where he puts on his old race tires and is my favorite

rogue one was the first star wars movie john williams didnt do the soundtracks for	really i didnt know that

you know aaliyah she was a famous artist in the 90s and early 2000s	oh right i had forgotten about her
i can imagine her voice in those movies	but her music in general is very relaxing and will always be a part of my relax favorites playlist
id have to say my favorite right now is bruno mars	seriously and you think the chainsmokers are a bad choice
really the rams right	no im flying back home to catch a ravens game
what was the punishment	brady got suspended for four games and the pats lost two draft picks
not quite as many memorable ones as in the first die hard though	thats true those lines are iconic

exorcist 2 was an abomination  just awful but part 3 was better than its given credit for	yeah 2 was really really bad
i do not like most of the sequels	they were not that bad
i think it is so impressive he went from a well known band to a well known solo artist in a whole other genre	what was his band called

i think it is a different story on excalibar	i do too it will be interesting to see how it is

i might check it out	you should its really upbeat
who are they	they were a backup band and they used to backup lynard skynard
why not	the score is too pulsating and overall its just yelling and fighting gives me a headache in my old age
yeah with that deep voice and the force choke	he was just unleashed in empire strikes back
you know whats a great comedy  bridesmaids	yes it was terrific  a wonderful cast
big is the key word if lacy balloons up to 260 pounds like last year when he was with green bay then nobody will be able to find russell in his shadow	his weight should not be a problem the man is skinny now that his contract requires him to be or else no bonus money
i would add jack to that too i loved donofrio in this movie	i did too
i think it came out in 2003	so you know that album pretty well
true i guess well see tonight	cant wait whens the next game
he belonged there	but he wasnt that crazy while still playing
yea the packers had 21 to the texans 13	okay i think ill try to catch the highlights on the internet later on
what ever happened to u2	what do you mean
that would be cool	stilli would of loved to see them
true but for some reason their voices just relax me i mean three of the greatest musicians of all time in one band well never see anything like that again	you mean john paul and george thats fair i guess the beatles could be considered the best band ever

this wedding invitation is becoming expensive maybe i just wont go	no no no relax i know a great store for dresses that always has good sales

yep  not one of their picks is still with the team	youre right  bruce davis  he was a linebacker right
watching that sort of movie on the big screen makes the entire movie come to life	who were some of the starring actors again
its so unpredictable though  who will win who will get hurt will there be a fight	you can watch survivor if you want that
what did you love about it	i loved the characters and the hot guys
yeah i did once i do not really recall it did you think it was better than his other car movies	it was just as good just did not get the same press he also did one called ww and the dixie dancekings similar movie
will smith was so good in that movie	definitly my favorite character
i did not feel like their story needed to be told	to each their own opinion i guess which one is your favorite
the entrance	hmmm
what about the falcons	i dont know about them last year was kind of a fluke for that team
it looked like it was made of old wallpaper but halle berrys dress was great	i loved that it looked like record albums
playoffs are already coming around wow thats crazy	i know i wish the season could last longer

i miss the old rock and roll days	they are not gone just pop in a cd
newer or classic rock	mostly the classics but i do like some newer rock
i actually really loved the first two	you mean when it used to be about street racing
so no ewoks in star trek movies	not even one whole other  world
i wasnt as familiar with their music as hall and oates but they were great too	i used to listen to them a lot when i was younger
what did you think of rey in the force awakens	i thought she was great  i cant wait to see her training with luke
yeah its like he turns it on when he wants to	with trout you know what production youre getting every year
how was that	they put on an incredible show
yeah im so glad a band like that exist	yeah what are some of your favorite songs from them
thats what i think  for music to sound good it must follow certain rules and those rules also create a finite amount of possible new music	unless we see new genres that break those rules  like harsh noise what if harsh noise as a protest to this became the new pop standard
i thought they were back together	they comeback then break up every once in a while
yeah	no i havent but i hear they put on a good show
it was actually that song that really got me into the alternative genre	how is that
mohana was released in 2016	yes on november 23 in the united states and then in the other countries
theres definitely some studio magic going on with her singing voice	i dont blame her though as long as shes making the music she likes its no harm done to me
why is that because most people would have said tupac or biggie	i think that biggie was better than tupac but i think that had both lived later in life they would have played out
yes that was the first movie i remember seeing at the theater	wow thats wonderful do you like any other spielberg movies
no real reason just wondering	oh okay  whats yours
same with wilson	yeah good enough to stay but cant carry a team
i cant believe hes still performing live hes in his 70s	hes still got to make a living
yes hard days night and help are definitely worth checking out	okay ill do that thanks

it was funny cheesy  but kind of moving	i like those old time travel cheesy films
but i feel like he killed that part of himself	no you never can physically do that
yes i see matt and with his wife in a stunning classic sky blue evening gown by vera wang with beautiful diamond earrings	look fashion alert  its katie perry in that horrible green dress and it looks like green vomit a fashion no no
and he was just reliving all his mistakes and his past	its more sad than a 20 something year old being angsty
what is your favorite star wars movie	to me the original star wars was the best you
he sang it live at the tonys and he deserved the standing ovation	several of my male voice students are taken with the songs from evan hansen
so basically anything pre garth brooks	exactly
gal gadot is wonder woman in this one right	mmhm shes an israeli actress and shes quite talented
yeah but it isnt all that bad	are there any women in it
the haunted mansion was on hbo today	oh man what did you think

whats the first thing rob says to hermione	im ron weasley
that makes sense	yeah its very good productive music
the movie was so good	well i can tell

given his injury history its almost guaranteed we see beatherd then	it give you that o line needs to step up keep hoyer on his feet or were done
thats a good point	yeah but i liked the movie
it is a really smart movie that is truly unique in many ways	how is that
he would have made the series more fun fewer explosions more story	well to be fair this one has swords not just explosions
raw talent yes but hes got a lot to work on off the field	yeah i hear you there i think hell do well fighting for a starting position
this movie really creeped me out	it definitely is a one of a kind movie
i think theres more than one reason but i gotcha	should be interesting well have to wait and see
my husband and i just had our anniversary and we went to a movie in the theater for the first time in 10 years	oh really  i love going to the theater  it is so much more immersive than just watching a movie at home
i agree i saw the preview and i wasnt impressed did you see any of the oscarnominated movies this year	actually just this week i saw lala land i was so uninformed i didnt even realize it was going to be a musical
have you ever seen them live	yes and it was royally disappointing they werent very good at all
i have a few sports trivia games if you would like to play	are there any nfl questions involved
i would imagine that it would man that looked brutal	yes hockey is a violent game but i love it
it totally was just look up dresses from the 20s youll see what i mean	either way i still think emma looked classy
yeah did you hear he passed	no not earnest
i wonder if he will make another classic	i think so
the stinky thing about it was that it was all in subtitles they spoke swedish	really you know barry wont watch anything like that i guess ill have to watch it when he is asleep
me too i thought that she would be annoying but she wasnt	now i really want to watch that movie again
you know because it is exciting	yep pretty much
yeah who do you think is going first	no clue either do the devils

i love movies dont i honey you seem to love them too so did you ever see that movie i spit on your grave	yes it was so serious i enjoyed the movie but i did not like the parts when those men took that woman to their country and set her up
you think so	yeah he is going to end up on the clippers i bet
she had some serious bouffant hair	that was the style then
it would have to take them to beat fleetwood for me	beatles and fleetwood are like the two greatest bands ever
i havent seen it yet	it is really good you should watch it
do you like the intro	yes it sounds good
what is mickeys story about	his is based off of gift of the magi
of course we did we would go shopping for special outfits	i also remember they had a movie didnt they

i guess i like the lesser characters addition to the movies	i agree the interactions between chewy and han are classic and c3po is sort of funny
like chicago versus detroit	yes or philadelphia versus the penguins
you know what would be cool	if jet li got a part in a action movie
the one with justin timberlake	exactly
well its a happy version	its great harrison ford came back
i think hell bounce back	i do too
look im just saying its very convenient that a guy who can see the future cant see anything about these cataclysmic events that end up changing and entire galaxy	i guess youre right that is a huge hole in the plot that takes up an entire movie franchise
i feel their selftitle from around 2008 was very well done and had some great songs	that was a good one nightmare which i think was their next album was also great
what do you mean by that	well the best coach is obviously bill belichick
do you like her dangerous woman album	that is one of my favorites
i mean i think amish paradise is a great song	it is and he is a great satirist
where is elton john  original from	he is original from pinner united kingdom

jagged little pill	yes the songs on that were everywhere for a year or so in the 90s
have you listened to the radio lately theres some awesome new pop hits	i have which ones do you like so far this summer
snow white and the seven dwarfs	dont you mean dwarves
well its country except its not except when it is	not less confusing how is it country
i gotta say die hard was still surprising good after all this time	if you liked die hard you should check out escape from new york
what kind of music do you like	i like alternative rock a lot of early 2000s alternative rock that is and a lot of older stuff too
i like samuel l jackson	i like him too  i think he is a good actor
what is the movie about	well lightning mcqueen is getting older and there are a lot of yournger and cooler cars
yeah i see what you mean i like the beatles better too overall	who are some of your other favorite rockers
what were they	he was with a boy and his family for years then went to be a police dog then he was a single woman and her familys after she got married then a bad owner after which he found his way back to the first owner
yeah i agree kill bill is one of my favorite movies	have you seen any good movies lately

good	so what other movies do you recommend
its got jim carrey in it	oh okay is that the movie where hes on tv
let me get my computer i saw the trailer and immediately wanted to see it	do you know what it is rated
how do you feel about the red flag replay system	the nfl needed this system 20 years ago its a plus but can be improved
i just hope they can keep it up the yankees have really retooled their organization	yeah but i would love to see david slay goliath
of course but jordy nelson has to stay healthy	this is true  but he had a phenomenal year last year
i am looking for a good playlist for a romantic night this weekend	what are you doing
yeah you should mention it to your wife and see if she would be interested	i can try but she loves shopping on sundays
wouldnt it be great if they played a final concert	sure except that john bonham is dead
yeah very but the acting is really awesome in it	its definitely stood the test of time
i think it was called drive	i think i saw that movie actually
so is the movie about their relationship	yes
hi	hello
well you will have to let me know what you think	i definitely will thanks for recommending it
he did the score to a classic sci fi film the day the earth stood still	you know i cannot even think of some of these films without hearing the score in my head
yeah so am i but i hear the acting and cg is wonderful	i heard that as well but live action remake seems a bit iffy to me
in 6 the crews scattered and letty suffers from amnesia and doms sister mia gets kidnapped but gets rescued and dom drives out of the exploding plane thats so lame	oh yeah yeah then the 7 is about letty regaining her memories and the english guys brother goes all crazy for vengeance
i would have to say julio jones and then antonio brown	come on man ab is definitely 1
what do you think about lee william	i think his songs is very interesting
did you ever hear any of the cheek to cheek album	i dont know it at all
would you say the little mermaid was a comedy	not any more than i would say that about alladin
no she is a newer indiepop singer	is she any good
you should really get back out there its too much fun not to	maybe ill go and try to find a pick up game later this week
sarah who	not sarah serendipity
what is your favorite indiana jones movie	probably raiders of the lost ark
did you play any other sports	no not really
some are blaming protests in 2016 for him remaining a free agent for four months now	well that could be part of it personally i dont think hes getting a fair chance though
probably not since it is so hot outside ill just catch all the news and observations online	i might head out to see how the newer players we got perform im really excited about brandin cooks
bob griese and billy kilmer	who scored first
yeah maybe 32 sacks last year	they should have drafted some oline
yes four year contracts to be more exact	how long does mikaila think he will play for the broncos
were supposed to talk about music	oh okay
i think well both just be happy of the patriots dont make it to the super bowl	aint that the truth im so over them even being in the super bowl
hey	hi
i just realized eminem doesnt rap alot about girls and weed	thats why i think hes the greatest of all time
yeah but im not sure if that still applies given all the rules changes from the past decade that tend to favor the offense	great defenses sill matter thats why i wouldnt count denver or kansas city out this season
they sing a song called radioactive	i remember that from the radio
not much have any suggestions	i kind of like that new justin bieber track
you have to watch it	why do you say that
i agree although i tend to be more on the mysterious and dark side of things haha	haha yeah you do whats your favorite dress in her new collection
i know i am glad alice was able to escape and get back home	the man who wrote this suffered from bad migraines
yep john can kill anybody the send and get past anybody they have try to protect the little putz	okay now i defintely want to see this movie
what was your least favorite one	tokyo drift was pretty bad
a football game	well
it was so sad when the step sisters destroyed the pink dress though	i know the mice and birds had worked so hard to make it special for cinderella
yeah  and did you know that the laire kid was also in super bad	oh yeah  thats right  he was mclovin i had forgotten that
did you hear about the womenonly showing	no whats that
best screen play best picture best director best actor best actress  just swept the oscars that year	jack nicholson was hilarious in that and made a good guy out of a bad guy
they should have bright in britton he wouldnt have cost us the game like that	he rd he best saver in baseball right now in my opinion
hard to believe hes been around so long but his stuff is easy to listen to	tonights the night hit 1 didnt it
that is a good point like snow white is always under attack	most fairytales disney movies are based on were even darker
hmmm i already saw that it wasnt very good	really i heard great things about it
well it seems like its really useless	because they can still get shot
but there were a lot of a good bands around that time	yeah and i liked some songs from those bands like nirvanas in bloom
in a way i agree with that but again we have to keep in mind that basically it was lennon and mccartneys group  they had almost always given george one cut an album no more and no less with the exception of abbey road as we mentioned  it was obviously harrisons role to be a great guitarist sing background vocals and leave the heavy lifting to paul and john	and to harrisons great credit i dont think he ever complained about that role  of course why would he complain he made so much money as a member of the group and he never had to feel the pressure of doing a lot of writing  yes rest in peace george
sure guys like mickey mantle for example made about 100000 per year tops  even though it was years ago it is just hard to figure out  were the owners making that much back then	thats a complicated issue  i just liked seeing guys like ty cobb sliding hard into base  most of the players today arent so aggressive  dont want to get hurt  the old timers sure were a tough group
i bought tickets to the cubs game  im bringing my son and his ball glove	ya never know  plenty of foul balls to be had
hey whats up man you excited for the seahawks season	oh for sure dude were gonna be great this year
thats a fantastic idea youll be able to see all the little differences im talking about	exactly thanks for the suggestion
who is featured on this song with justin beiber	i believe its luis fonsi and daddy yankee
yeah but that is kind of the thingi tended to just listen to their first few very will known tracks	but they have a surprisingly deep discography
is it the cowboys that got oxnard california	yes they do and they have a brand new practice facility
are you serious i thought it was great	ugh the plot line was so slow i couldnt stand it
i never heard that before i thought she was an amazon	she is an amazon princess and grew up on a secret island with her mother
im still sad about snapes death in movie and real life	me too snape was a great character
the terrorist bombings in england are freaking me out	me too but the benefit concert ariana grande did for the birmingham victims that was broadcast this weekend was outstanding with pharrellcoldplay take that miley cyrus justin bieber and more i recorded it
we all can get together	will be a blast
yeah pretty nice	you dont sound enthusiastic about your comment whats wrong
yeah people forget about him but not all that long ago he was the man	yeah kind of the grandfather of alternative today
what is your favorite video	i really like the poker face video
wild hearts cant be broken was such a good movie	it was she had this dream and it came true
yeah thats what the point of us talking is	true i would say the butterfly effect
go ahead	they should be able to draft anyone they want if someone is 20 and able to transition easily go for it
that one is hilarious	is that the one with jason bateman
yes man	youre awesome
did you watch the star wars rogue one movie	yes i did sad ending but the story was well very well written do you think theyll do another movie with the same characters
thats fantastic if its anything like split i think im there opening night	count me in im sold
yeah they will be lucky to get him	i think that hes trying to make up his mind
i guess	did you ever see misery
she said he talked about how that was his favorite band and how it inspired him to become a singer too	billy joels had a long career and a lot of hits
i like norwegian wood	what a coincidence me too
i liked californication	that was a good song
there seemed to be a lot more fighting than usual	well the two teams are rivals
i liked it too i also liked halloweenh20 when she was the dean of the school and josh hartnett was her son	that was well done too i loved the part where she sent her son and girlfriend off and battled michael by herself
thats something  is she going to wear a veil	yes one of those fingertip veils
well yeah we want to filter the world but thats not how the world is	i dont know i just am very conservative
sounds cool any favorites that you watch on it	oh sure many actually independence day is one we love watching so much action and explosions
i watched pulp fiction for the first time today	wow that is a real classic cult action film
well if you wanna come over sometime we can rock down memory lane	thatd be cool i dont get to hear them on the radio as much anymore
i cant believe they ever let dungy go	i know  the whole town was in disbelief
that was a great song not sure what else is on the album can you list some	sure i know what i know diamonds on the soles of her shoesyou can call me al those are my other top faves
its country  its a song about his father	is it sad
i like melanie martinez	i dont know if ive heard of her
oh interesting who is the quarterback	deshone kizer for now he is actually from ohio
he was kind of a brat but he was at least fun to watch	i like his lightsaber its very different from whats been done in the other movies
oh the guitarist with the who hes done great interviews about all the old equipment the tubepowered stuff right off the top of his head	right and maybe your complaint about digital music sounding dead and sterile explains why records and tube amps came back again
what movie did kurt russel have the eye patch in	escape from new york
the market has set out a specific number for a franchise qb	yeah you dont see most of them hit free agency
i also heard that dak was using a machine to sign all his memorbilia	really so what he is not signing himself or what
yeah not bad	good  were supposed to talk about basketball
are you a fan of boba fett	absolutely  i wonder sometimes if he survived the sarlaac pit and they will bring him back
nfl season is upon us who do you think will win it all	i hate to say it but you gotta go with the patriots right
yes their vocals are amazing	i enjoy listening to them
probably not  and then with vcrs we were watching things from the 60s	yeah and even earlier
did you know that lady gagas real name is stefani joanne angelina germanotta	wow thats a mouthful
london calling is just so musically varied though	it is but their self titled album is so raw and aggressive
what is it	its a werewolf movie
i am torn between her or julie newmarboth were great as catwoman	i agree they both were iconic in the role
i think carson wentz can beat out russell wilson as a quarterback any day honestly we dont have to trade around so much when weve got solid talent	ha ha i guess well see about that then
the way francona manages this team is the best ive seen since mike hargrove	not even close francona is the best manager cleveland has had in my lifetime
yeah all that music is from when we were growing up the music that i think defines our generation since im in the middle is the late 80s to early mid 90s	you mean alternative rock and the grunge movement yeah i totally get that i didnt listen to a lot of radio i got music from friends and we passed it around
jakob silfverberg was the one who tied it up for the ducks turning it into a 22 game	oh i know that rinne is a great goalie and would turn it around
i need to check that out	the lead singer has a very unique voice
and thats exactly my point her best stuff is the music she did was like 25 years ago	no way has been pushing the pop industry well through the 90s and 2000s

why do you like the giants	i grew up in the new york area and hate the jets
do you listen to lady gaga	i listen to her stuff here and there mostly just on the radio
hmmm so much for true love	it was puppy dog love in the end
but cleveland scored three more	ah nice try boston
the others are the titans chargers eagles bengals panthers falcons and cardinals	im surprised the cardinals havent ever won
well i know she is still on tour and i think he is in the studio	i cant wait for him to go on tour

yeah a kid and an old man going on a special trip with a flying house	i cant believe i still remember it so vividly after so many years
that seems right on the money	you can see it in most of the advertising
same theyre classics	they are  i watched them as a kid so theyre nostalgic
probably years afterward i was kind of young when it first came out	then what id say is that you probably dont realize that seven seems cheesey and cliched because for years afterward there were like 3 movies a year made who were ripping off seven
holy cow that is a lot of money	then came toy story 2
i am so excited about the upcoming nfl season	are you rooting for the patriots
it stands for badbadnotgood	that is a strange name
take milf money for example  that song didnt make any damn sense the lyrics and the style were all over the place	ok you have a point with one song but i still dont think shes all bad

do you like movies based on books	no they are all horrible
meh everyone is a little weird	he remember the part where he hid the spears and destroyed the calvary
inglourious basterds i think its the height of both his dialogue and his characters	im in the midst of watching all the tarantino movies and so far basterds is my favorite
me too probably the best songs of any disney movie	and its cool that theres a black princess for little girls to look up to
ok definitely warren sapp	yes he was an awesome player
they have a great rythem and capability to mix i just love their mixes	have you ever been to an elecronic concert
i wonder if this means that theyll tour again	i imagine that they will whats the point of a new album if you dont play it live
neville out of everyone at hogwarts you like neville i bet you are going to tell me you like luna too huh	what is wrong with that neville got so brave at the end standing up to voldemort

me toowhat are your favorites	i love the wedding singer
how about i school you as to why i feel that way	please by all means
i like boyz to men but id listen to new edition before them	new edition with or without bobby brown
right but you couldnt see the marte situation coming	no but you should have had a better backup plan than john jaso
i remember that they also sang that brian wilson song	yes one of the best
i use it only for specific purposes	oh great taste
what did you like about wonder woman	unlike the other films you mentioned wonder woman had a great plot and you really come to care bout the characters
yeah you have a point they were very memorable	exactly to infinity and beyond
i wish there were more girl groups out right now	me too the only one that comes to mind is fifth harmony
well youve seen that youtube video where a person recreated every chain smoker song right  their music is so generic	well agree to disagree  you do you and ill do me
i had no clue  what was the original song	the original song was was out of my head by fastball
well yeah better to be a slave of a parfumer than of leather making	so whats so great about this movie
i saw them live in kansas city  it was a great show  super high energy	sounds like my kind of show
i like their song dont let me down	yeah i do too i also like the legendary hey jude
well a few years ago i started listening again and i found myself really liking it	oh yeah what changed your mind
you probably have their music is used in a lot of movies and shows even today even though they were mostly an 80s band	oh really
exactly but i think there time has passed the yankees are the team to beat this year	yeah looks like the yankees have retooled
she wrote to her saying how harry potter was the only thing that kept her mind off her problems	what problems did she have
thats an answer i didnt expect	i just loved the friendship they shared i also loved the way they designed stitch
it sounds like it could be	he threw in lots of totally ridiculous and overthetop love scenes and insane dialogue and just weird performances from all the supporting actors
i prefer roughness	same
and every once in a while i just have to watch the emperors club	the emperors club i dont think ive ever heard of that
bummer  that would have been a great concert	maybe we can get tickets to his show in dallas
this also means no deadpool appearance either	wow that really sucks
what would you say your favorite was	i loved land before time
the part where he met beast was one of my favorite parts	he did look menacing didnt he
what is your favorite color lightsaber	i like the purple one mace windu had
i know what song youre talking about  f you im drunk	that was just funny

i am watching a movie whatcha doing	nothing much working
we need a trumpet player do you play that	i do ill grab my trumpet and come over to start practicing
i am not to fond of them sort of movies but i watch them time to time	what do you usually like
the rest of the pirates movies were not as good i dont think	the second one was okay but yea then the series kind of went off the rails
do you think all the people on alderaan died i mean all of them	what do you mean the planet blew up right
did you remember all the hype over the girl with the dragon tattoo	yes i do remember all the talk
true true but nobody can win a game	yea well those guys are games you wanna go against them
hes done songs with guys like j cole kendrick lamar and drake all solid rappers	alright then ill give them a chance
right yeah thom yorke is the lead singer of radiohead	does he write all the music mostly
yeah but people recognized it because but was different for a guy to make movies for adults	yeah he was good though
no i wouldnt suggest it  its frustrating more than anything  after chris nolans dark knight series this is just a letdown	ah well hopefully theyll get it right next time
me too  how about youya got a preference between dc and marvel movies	marvel movies all the way  i mean dc is cool with superman and batman but thats about their biggest  marvel has way more cool characters
are you into lady gagas music	yes sometimes
jaws started the hollywood blockbuster	was that in 1975
did you see that story about the raiders	no
nuance such as what	well hes this really good politician and evil jedi but he is also really sympathetic
do you have to pay	no it is a free service
now he does old persons comedies	well he himself is getting up there in age
u2 has put out some good new music	i havent heard it not a fan of u2 any way
im talking ponder  hes a stiff a hasbeen a neverwas a imrunninghomeand cryintomama kind of player  just like jim everett	he made it to the nfl so he must have had some skills
yea probably because thats who he is in real life	obviously but hes also really funny and caring too
i love the cartoon	oh its my favorite sing sweeet nightingale sing sweet night in  gale
i saw the trailer  it looks like they did a great job so creepy	ya it looks better than the original film to me i love tim curry as penny wise but this updated version looks amazing
yeah i didnt see it live but ive seen clips from nfl films	ill have to check those out
so you think its gonna be a non excitement game	i think it will be so stereotypical that it will be tied at the end and whoever recieves the ball will win it
did you watch adam sandler movies back when they were popular	i loved big daddy especially such a cute movie
i think its an experiment worth trying	i do too its going to be an exciting year for the lakers
i know its ridicuous	i have no clue why people still watch them
shes an american pop singer	does she sing anything i would know
are you sure about that	yes i am pretty sure
i believed it once i heard madonnas record	i hope she releases another album soon
im sure seahawks fans seem to be some of the most passionate in the league	we are for sure we have a world record to prove it
the patriots	the most hated team in the nfl
why though	because it is ridiculous
thats too bad	yeah i had a couple friends who wanted to join but werent good enough
yeah a feelgood ending	well thats not what was supposed to happen
fine choice	yeah it is
they had alot of tension they broke up very quickly	its always hard to keep the band together
well my personal favorite is stalingrad	okay i can guess what that one is about but do they have anything from ww1
i think ive heard of the songs theyre pretty unique	theyre not super mainstream but i enjoy it
yeah like hook and the live verison of peter pan not just the cartoon	there was also that newer one but i cant remember what it was called
its scary	that doesnt mean its horror
i just wish they took their fans more seriously	yeah they do treat us like dirt
i know i would never have stayed as long as he did with all the crazy screaming parents	ill never understand how two adult men can get into a fist fight over a little league baseball game
i know youre probably too young but do you know anything about the beetles	yeah my parents used to listen to their songs when i was a kid
how do you mean how were they similar	rey is on a desert planet very similar to tatooine and a lot of other things are very similar between the two movies
i am watching this movie called dead alive	is it good
do you like the acting	snape is great and so is daniel as harry
well you wanna know mine	sure i am cool with that
who do you think she does the best	i think she does britney spears and celine deon really well
yeah i miss the old matis	that stinks maybe ill listen to his old stuff
nick carter used to be so cute	yes he was my definite favorite
i am concerned though that the penguins have a couple of injuries	yeah it is a little alarming but someone else always seems to set up
do you think they will make new ones	i think they already are
did you ever play	i did in high school  i was hoping to get drafted but i hurt my leg
i think the texans had the best defense statistically even though they played only average	it really depends on the strength of a teams schedule otherwise the numbers dont mean a whole lot
norman bates was seriously a disturbed character	yeah the entire premise was bizarre
the scene where he was running from the chef was hilarious	yes it was the whole movie was wonderful  a true classic
it was a shift away from that popmetal or melodic hard rock i will have to admit	yes it was it was sort of depressing by comparison
what about your girlfriend does she like this music	not really shes more into fur fashion
the movie banked a ton of money yet the singing was suspect	the songs were great in it  im not sure what your beef is
sure but its still a good song	i just dont really like mccartney as a singer
if you say so but i did like the new darth vader like guy	yeah he was a cool character a little whiny though
i wonder why musicians are always the ones to take up the causes for fundraising though how come you never see sports teams putting on a charity show	thats true sometimes actors have fundraiser private parties but you never see groups doing the big charity events like musicians do
they like giving him the ball alot	if teams cant stop him thats a good idea
i think so too and i like how they did the back story to leia and the ships map	it makes the original make more sense
those are two of my favorite buddy guy songs without a doubt	those songs are what turned me on to blues music
what do you mean	they just pump those movies out nonstop i cant even keep up
i know but if you had to choose who would be your top players	well definitely tom brady
its supposed to be ridiculous its over the top and the corny dialogue makes it even better	the only reason id watch it is because ludacris is in it
what are your favorite bands from the early 2000s	linkin park papa roach red hot chili peppers
i think that siemian was pretty decent though	its ok for you think thati dont
great  you a basketball fan	i am a fan
that honestly feels like sooo long ago refresh my memory i havent watched the orginial movie in years	brians an undercover cop and tries to infiltrate doms shop to catch a group of street racer theives dom doesnt take kindly to brian snooping around but brian challenges dom to a street race something dom cannot turn down
i believe that they did	wow they must have been working with some very talented producers and directors
i did know maybe because she died	or more just the amount of talent in that one marriage kind of astounds me
yes it is so soothing to hear the lead singers voice	yes he is talented
sounds funny	oh it is  google it
so it means the cleveland browns are as good as the new england patriots	not exactly what it really means is that the browns will get the most help from the draft
well have you heard this new indie artist named christa cossey	no is she good
what was the name of that mexican man who was searching for jack sparrow	captain salazar
meh	you dont like hendrix he pretty much started the rock guitar solo
youtube now	okay okay
hey if it bothers you we dont have to talk about it	thanks i appreciate you saying that
me neither but hes really talented and it isnt all the same stuff	i get so bored of the moneyandwomen thing in rap
how about progressive rock isnt that similiar	somewhat i do like progressive groups as well
do you like the band one republic	yes i like the song they sing called counting songs a lot
nirvana pearl jam and the smashing pumpkins were all awesome	if you had to pick one which would you go with
yeah that year he almost beat the record that was great	he is getting old though
true he does have that high pitched voice but still	they have alot of the progressive rock tones that rush uses and used
what age did you start learning your guitar	i started to learn guitar when i was in 5th grade and my teacher was a blind man
definitely i was so happy the parents got married at the end	yes and i was so happy the two maids got together too
i love this but its messed up so id like to make a bag out of it	we can do that right now if you have the thread and stuff
yeah i know which album youre talking about	american idol produced a lot of good artists
thats what i am saying	not sure how you overcome that
how much does a new wardrobe cost	about two thousand
thats a very good point  he is this brutal person yet so moral when it matters	thats why he is my favorite
i will what happens in this movie	a robot goes back in time to try to destroy a man who will save humanity in the future
can you name the teams with the record for the most super bowl wins	the dallas cowboys the san francisco 49ers and the pittsburgh steelers share the record for most super bowl wins
how do you mean	i think tupac is the best lyricist and notorious big has the best flow i think eminem is the best at rhyming
really what is it about	it´s about this person who´s been given the chance to see what would had happen if he had chosen to have a family instead of a mayor career
oh nice	yeah
who specifically i cant think of any	the patriots and ravens obviously
i liked him a lot he was a really good quarterback	yea he came so close to winning us a superbowl i still think about that game
im about the same a little less though around 300 bucks	funny thing is that you have to keep track of all the point makers like assists shots etc for the skaters and the goalies post points for each saves and wins
right it was so forced at the end of the movie i couldnt care less if the woman died	the whole movie was bad the only character i liked was princess ahmanet
jennifer aniston tj miller and that guy  i cant remember his name  the guy from arrested development	jason bateman
plus it would be the first back to back to back finals in nba history	yeah i care less about that but it would be fun
well that was a missed opportunity they shouldve opened with rematch	i think the nfl may have done that a few years ago and the coaches didnt like it
i just feel if i wanted to hear something different i would just listen to a different artist	that does make a lot of sense i do sometimes as well
yeah each sister is just like one of aunties one was very much the perfectionist another very critical one down on her luckthey all complained about each other as much as they loved each other	thats just family did you have history of your family coming over from china like the movie
my mom once thought that lucy in the sky with diamonds was an elton john song	really
i heard that one song he was featured in by big sean	no favors
theres also a song called ill show you it has the best beat on the whole album	i dont think i know that one ill check it out
it was mediocre he wasnt really as engaging as he is in wrestling promos	thats kind of normal though especially for a movie thats in its fifth sequel already you cant expect much
i wonder who will show out this season cam newton has been on it lately	cam has put dances on the map
is mickey mouse in any disney movies	oh sure
i really want to see dunkirk  have you heard anything about it	not anyone thats seen it  it doesnt come out until july  looks like it may be good
thats true what do you think about pirates of carribean	oh right i almost thought disney only makes animations
yeah it was may 5 2017	yeah i knew it was somewhere around there
i completely agree thats why this movie drew me in initially carla cugino basically is his surrogate mother who raises him on the base station on mars and she also accompanies him back to earth	shes such an underrated actress she was really terrific in sin city as well as sucker punch
is that ed sheerans new music you are listening to	yeah shape of you by ed sheeran
that was a great movie	mischance barton was in it right
did you catch the jimi hendrix reference in cars	when sarge was raising his flag
are you exited to see the new kingsman movie	i am i liked the first part a lot
yeah but everyone knew who freddy was in every movie scream gave plot twists in all 4 changing the origins with each	look if youre throwing out my remake then you dont get to count the 4th scream
yeah the egyptian gods and how rod and by trying to take over the world	yeah i seen that when i was pretty good where you had to walk through the water gates to go to different planets
its a shame that she died so young	very tragic  they will honor leia im sure
at least he played the character well	true my favorite would probably be andrew garfield hes fantastic in everything
what do you think of the newest star wars movies	i think disney is doing them justice and i have been thoroughly enjoying them
i feel like it really isnt working all the well though	yeah a lot of big name players still get hurt from illegal plays every year
what about a broom stick	thatd work too
did you hear about your favorite player	no what
they still have it there passion hasnt softened over time unlike metallica	yes metallicas old stuff is clearly better i guess they just cant muster up that same anger in their old age
yeah you are probably right	i cant believe though that some players still do them
i agree do you remember what songs you heard from the birthday massacre when they were imagica	i think it was one song called happy birthday
plus people love sports because they love rooting for a team	yep thats why people get so invested in it
hi there what kind of music have you been listening to lately	hi and ive been listening to a lot of instrumental music
it really is  the part where the mother sings baby mine is so sweet	i know  i still sing that to my children
thats a creepy one	for current tv shows i would say the theme from hawaii 5 o is really good
jason momoa is the perfect casting for aquaman	if youve seen game of thrones then you know how great he is going to be
i used to be the biggest korn fan ever i jammed coming undone relentlessly	i never get tired of listening to nirvana kurt cobain was a legend who will forever be missed
whats it all about	they believe that the forest is kind of like a parent and that music is the best way to communicate with their parent
thats a great idea thanks	your welcome
im going to johns to watch the game sunday wanna come	why would you waste a beautiful day inside watching a bunch of men run around in the mudare you kidding
how do you mean	like what if he made trance music to help animals relax
do you think theyll repeat their season	well its kind of early to tell but they look good
the new album sounds so happy but hayley is so sad there	her lyrics are more emo than ever to be honest
they also got a good outing from nick martinez	yeah he only gave up 1 unearned run over 5 innings
wish i could remember his name	i liked that they played more modern music in it too
you made the correct choice	luckily this year seems to be better for the movie industry
remember when i was in high school pop music was nsync and britney spears	i love the music of today ed sheeran and lady gaga are amazingly unique
i couldnt agree more and i have such a total celebrity crush on emma	you would im more into eliza dushku myself
yeah agreed i love seeing the fashion its so fun the oscars is like prom for celebrities	totally its always fun to see who wore what best
i  think the best fit for griffin would be the thunder	oh man they would instantly become a favorite to win the west
well i got complained to and beraded for saying this	what was it you said
not really hamilton did well	yes for a specific audience
i wonder why it was for that one	it was great but i agree hes done more worthy work
looks like pittsburgh should have picked ryan over sidney crosby back when they were drafted 1st and 2nd overall	i dont know about that the penguins have won a stanley cup in the last 2 years while ottawa hasnt won the cup in forever
oh yeah i saw that movie at least ten times when i was a kid	me too i could say every phrase before it was spoken
shut up thats star wars	i know ha
did you see that recent disney movie	moana yeah it was so good
even more than r2d2 and c3po	i know hes newer and dead now but k2so has the best personality
yeah thats the one have you seen it	i have actually and it was really good will turner comes back and jack sparrow is around of course
i know a few of each of their songs but not much  how about the new gwen stefani album	i havent heard any of the songs on the radio but there are a few good tunes
exactly they would be the coolest dudes in the galaxy cooler than han	you got that idea from their movie
the way he was able to beat the d and then the goalie was awesome	i know fleury never had a chance
i know you know who was cute	those munchkins they were adorable
why do regular people leave behind corpses when the corpses of jedi vanish	i think its because jedi are so in tune with the force that their corporeal selves become a part of it when they die
he used to do a lot of disney	huh never knew
whats your favorite song by him	id have to say the ballad of billy the kid
exactly the case she convinces her husband to try to help out as many of the local towns folk who are mostly jewish to escape the nazi regime	how do they go about this
how do you not when dom took his id and said brian spilner that sounds like a serial killers name	oh yeah ok now i remember dude how many times did you watch that movie
i can but its still nice to see it once in a while when it comes on tv	the original hasnt been on for awhile but i did see they made a remake of it that was on a few weeks ago did you watch it
he did a lot of fantasy film scores and they are all amazing mysterious island had those crashing cymbals in the main theme	just the music for that intense balloon sequence at the beginning really got the blood moving and set you up for the rest of the adventure
yeah that was neat to see  and the fact they killed him off	it was an accident but it was a great way for him to poke fun at himself
sounds like your typical dying girl romance story	well i hadnt really thought about it like that but yeah you are right it does
his dad is larry mcmurtry he wrote the last picture show and lonesome dove and a bunch of other books that were made into movies	when is that concert again
what are you listening to	greenday
hey i heard a great new band the other night	what are they named where did you see them
do you know any of anne´s earlier movies	of course she started to get famous with the princess diaries series
yeah definitely  i bleed cheese	dont remind me of the aaron rodgers hail mary from last season
let me guess is it because of the fast  furious films	you guessed correctly those really sold me on his acting ability
thats a fair point its really not a realistic kind of movie	i think if they would have gone with an animation like avatar it could have been awesome
like an artist that all of your favorite artists like or all your friends with similar taste like or who all the critics are hyping	oh i get what youre saying now i for sure have had that happen sonic youth is my prime example
do you still listen to project 86	sure do
i havent heard of him before	hes got a great tiny desk on youtube you should check out
who do you like better taylor swift or avril lavigne	i honesly cant choose i love them both
yes the dog that plays basketball	that was cute
cool did you ever play organized baseball	yeah i played through senior year of high school
it would of been better if he was trained by the both of them at the same time	yes he would have better skills
another great one keep them coming	homeward bound by simon and garfunkel
anways i loved talking to you	same
he has been stuck in mediocrity but i think he has had little help	he tends to do a lot of safe passes
i think i saw the first one years ago some guy named neo	played by keanu reeves
it was the white sox won the game in the bottom of the thirteenth with a grand slam	did wheeler start at the pitchers mound again
what did you think of the beatles sgt peppers lonely hearts club band and the songs on that album	i loved im fixing a holei find that it really used to echo something that i felt in my life
how many albums did they make	i think they did 9 albums
a lot of her music is upbeat you should listen to an album of hers	which album would you suggest
i was just thinking about it the other day  i really hated the ending	which is sad because the rest of the movie is constructed pretty well
yes that scene with the hook is really frightening	i agree that movie seemed so realistic
bateman is so freaky in that keeping his mother all those years	and that shower scene i still hate taking a shower with a curtain
i really dont know if it is	probably remixed or songs of the past
i think i started off more of a nightmare on elm street fan but after they made freddy krueger too comical it lost me	yeah i think i with friday the 13th you know what youre getting with jason he never says a word he just goes on his way with his cleansing of crystal lake
it is definitely pop but it has some rb influence for sure	do you have any favorite songs
he was so religious for a while too	but then he started doubting again
not anymore	i kind of got over them
ive seen the trailer once or twice somewhere and it looked interesting	so should i watch it
me too i thought those movies were well written and really good they reminded me a lot more of the original films	yeah its great that they have awesome female leads in the series again plus rey finn and jyn are pretty awesome characters
how are you doing today	very well and you
it does look like a place that exists in real life	yep it does i want to go visit that place
well you dont have to be a musician to love a good tune	i listen mostly to soft rock
imagine hearingsummer windor lady is a tramp	i cant imagine how good it had to be
i think the main issue is their bullpen	yeah every game i watch they are in the game into the starting pitcher gets pulled and then they start getting shelled
why did they break up	i heard it was because the lead singer needed to have surgery and they didnt want to wait for him to heal
yeah try to make as many films as possible and see what spurns sequels	nothing that he has done so far is sequel worthy in my opinion
firework is really catchy too i like some of her lesser known songs like pearl and circle the drain	sometimes it seems like the best songs that artists have are the less popular ones
this is a  creative new monster sure we have plenty of scary clown movies but this one was unique in that the man literally turns into the clown against his own will as the suit and decorative attire just absorb into him	i love the sound of this concept plus is sounds as if it was very creepy
what makes it so special	well b6 and 4 resolve to 5 making two chromatic voices approach the dominant by halfstep which is very strong
its not completely impossible for them to win it	john kennedy was about to get inaugurated the last time they won a superbowl
i actually thought some punches were going to be thrown	i know it got really heated really fast
deadpool was great dont forget about that	ryan renyolds killed it in deadpool  i cant wait for the next one
oh yeah what years	1989  1993
lugias song was nice too	i learned it on the piano
i saw that	andy reid will keep them in it
i think theyre on the levels as those teams and i think youll see marvin lewis really coach them to that next level this season	theyre going to win 9 games at the most
i used to like them but they god rid of payton manning	yea it was a sad time but we got andrew luck
i think so too who was your favorite character	probably gus played by robert duvall
whys that	the main draw for me was bryan cranston since i love breaking bad but he was barely in it
thanks for helping me with this	no probably whats the survey for
thank you mom my favorite player of all time was on that team	which player was that
is george lucas involved in the next star wars movies	you mean writing the script
i remember seeing it in the theatre as a kid but they didnt release it on tape back then	i didnt know that i wonder why they didnt release it
what is the length of the longest home run run ever hit	im not sure but i would say its around 600 feet
yes she has	what are some other movies you like with her
what was your favorite song	say it aint so
that is a great one  how did you like him in daddys home	thought he did great  i think he and will ferrell work great together
did you know that she was the original singer of i will always love you	you mean before whitney houston
oh yeah  i was wiping away tears the whole time  such a good movie	maybe theyll make a sequel
what are your favorites	i like beast of burden and paint it black  i probably like sympathy for the devil the best
kind of weird but entertaining up to that point	most definitely
i couldnt handle that kind of injury at my age and im 22	thank goodness for all that padding and body protection they wear
why do you say that	just like any sale the mlb is trying to get people in the door to sample the product by giving it away for freemost americans have lost interest in baseball
yes it has gotten some good reviews	i heard that it is better than the last film they made
let me turn it up  im listening to break out now	ok awesome
dak being the man now in dallas means carrying all the weight	he is a talent  dallas had to move on he just has to win  if he starts losing the people will turn quick in dallas and start talking about romo
have you seen that movie from last year starring emma stone and ryan gosling	la la land
thats how people become millionares in this country	how do i get a copyright for my idea
its pretty good you should watch it	didnt that come out a while ago
im so jealous i didnt know they would split up	maybe theyll do a reunion show one day i would definitely go see them again
yeah he makes all those weird movies	weird is good
yep captain kirk is playing with wonder woman	star trek was good cant wait for the next one
they have bad management	that must be the reason
do you like lincoln park	yes they are a great band
i agree her live shows are pretty bad now	she doesnt have much energy
right because they were able to spend money elsewhere on support players	yeah its hard to keep a good roster together when youre paying one player a ton of money
you have to choose one	sad but true by inches i can listen to that song any time and get pumped
i love disney movies  have you ever seen snow white	i sure have its and oldie but a goodie for sure i think it came out in the 30s
it is so good to enjoy music you havent heard in so long	what brought that on are you listening to something right now
you dont think thats a good enough standalone story	well when i think of an uncharted movie i think of charming explosive action
it wasnt what i expected after all the hype	like how
have you seen any good movies	not really how about you
have you seen the new star wars movie	i havent yet is it still in theaters
i am such a big fan of country music arent you	ditto
who opened for them	i really dont remember
yeah that is probably the worst ever	yeah that was probably one of the first super bowls i vividly remember
it would be weird to see a new captain america	yeah i think so too
nah your whack bro	meh
i know he holds nfl records for rushing yards for a quarterback	did you realize he played 13 seasons in the nfl with four different teams
he made a cool so called faith	yeah he also made a great song calledlast christmas that was a holiday song
was it	no it was a weak book
but it still sucks	eh gotta take your rose tinted glasses off
i hope the predators do good in the playoffs	yeah im hoping to atleast get to the finals
no way thats awesome	yeah their last album had no hits on it
thats so funny i never thought of it like that but i guess thats true	yeah teenage girls went just as crazy over the beatles as they have over nsync and one direction
no way van hajen is good but they arent the best of all time	ok then who is
thats a good one too	and hes cute too
do you like star wars	i love it and george lucas so much
steep price  hes a perennial pro bowler	no i get that just saying it was still a first round pick they had to burn
power was probably my favorite song in the entire album though	i liked another album of hers the best it is prism
and they are going to need gasol and aldridge to play well in all 7 games	and of course they need kawhi back healthy and playing at a high level
hi	hey
i liked the way i am	ive never heard that one
yeah i just dont understand it it seems vulgar	some of it is its hard to generalize
maybe her lyrics are very explicit	ok i can attempt to listen to it
i like their more simple tunes like i will or blackbird	theyre both on the white album right
oh i know what you are talking about with regards to 2004	yes that and numb really brings back memories of that time in my life and the positive things that happened
have you seen central intelligence yet	no i havent who is in it
did you see the outfits at the met gala this year	yes wasnt rihannas outfit crazy
do you watch the super bowl every year	not every year ive seen a good majority in the last few years though
dont be like that	their music dissent catch my ear
yes but go into the future	i thought they would go back again
what would you say is the worst booktomovie adaptation that youve seen	thats a tough question considering most are usually not as good as the source material
me too the previews look good	they do
annabelle is one of my favorite thriller genres within the last five years	how about we see a romantic comedy
thats fascinating  who is someone that i can check out	i would recommend stanley jordan

its a great movie for kids	yes theres great lessons to be learned

yes thats all i think about when i hear it i still remember the moves	me too we will have to do them on the cruise
yes i love that movie harley is so funny in the movie i seem to relate to her in a crazy way	i can see what you mean  i love will smith playing the sniper
who is the quarterback now for the bronchos	who knows who the quarterback will be for the bronchos this season
in the movie ares is just a glorified arms dealer rather than a credible threat to the world	how about the way she handled him though she went all super saiyan
why would he do that	he wanted to avenge padmes death
what did you do this weekend	nothing much really listened to some music and watched a movie
he does in a  way the only one  i  struggled  with was one  where he  was  called the  beast	did it  cross over into  any of the other movies like  signs
yes of course they had some top level talent	yeah but that instructor was insane
aww everybody does love that movie its timeless	i like old movies jimmy stewart was such a charismatic actor
i hate how you are shown that the hero may die	yeah thats typical in these comic type films
you can pull it up on youtube	you got me just about to do that i hope my neighbors dont complain
i hate that orlando bloom and kiera knightly arent in it anymore	yeah im not sure why they left them out
true guys dont last very long there and bell has a history of injuries	yeahi think one more injury and he is done

i dig the album	what about the comic
he put pressure on simba that nala may not have been able to do	i would have liked to see simba stay in the jungle at the point he returns he was not aware of what was going on
i agree	i saw her in concert
yeah because theyre both really good	which one do you like better
yeah and its really refreshing david byrne would probably think its derivative of talking heads but i dont care its great	i love it when artists take a risk like that and totally go in a new direction if theyre talented enough it almost always pays off
i am not really sure maybe it is genetic	well most of them are black
how many games do you think they will win	i would say 97 or 98
well jason didnt actually have a hockey mask	oh really what did he have
you know what else is weird	here we go again
quentin tarantino is the best	definitely
that makes sense actually	i mean i have a terrible voice so no one wants to listen to me sing some normally beautiful song badly
i think that organ went a long way toward defining the doors sound	no doubt  jim may have been the star but it took all four
hes also got marshall and shepard	might be the best receiving core in the league
what do you think of exo	exowhat is that
true but not very many good ones	true the disney animation was the best to date
we shouldnt  have traded mccann	well sanchez is a good dh and hes a great catcher
you know metallica was inspired by sabbath	i think all metal bands were inspired by sabbath
i can agree with that	it just seems that the pro bowl game is for revenue not rewarding success
how are you	great you
yes he does	do you know his name
my favorite song was paparazzi what was yours	that was a good song but mine is poker face it is such a classic
well if tom savage wins the job and makes it through the year it cant be too bad	i guess so that means watson can learn and the team is doing good
some teams cant play any defense	the saints give up a ton of points a game
he isnt really the main character but his acting is good nonetheless	ill have to check it out
eh if you want	yays
you still remember a lot about him	yes i believe i will always remember the solo from hangin
that would be cool and that bird guy that helps maleficent could be in it still	well sure they should have all the original characters including sleeping beautys father
what do you think of the packers chances of making the superbowl	as long as they have aaron rodgers anything is possible
i agree with that what other movies do you suggest	well it is an old one but what about billy madison
huh youd think americans wouldve come up with something sooner	well the genre spread quickly after that 30s were the time when many of the superheroes were made up
i really like movies where one of the main characters gets hurt or dies and his or her lover cries over them	haha thats interesting
sounds lovely i saw some print bridesmaid dresses in a magazine	ooh that sounds a little distracting
mostly i like his attitude and ability on the football field	i agree because he seems to let his play do the talking
what do you mean	well when i was young pop music was from bands like the beach boys
nah not yet	you are in for a treat
john cusack is good i like his movies	me too
thats a great idea	fantastic ill bring the popcorn
i could see those two teams tampa was in the playoff hunt last year	and they are playing in the nfc south seems like a different team wins that division every year
you plan on getting out to any games this season	maybe if i can get seats at a reasonable price  otherwise ill invest in a new tv
bob dylan no question	hes fantastic but i have to be in the mood for him i would say he writes the best lyrics for sending your thoughts all over the place
i loved that it featured so many big stars like arnold schwarzenegger and jesse ventura	jesse ventura is so entertaining i loved him in predator

2 steps from hell comes to mind i really like their music because its so epic	i know one of their songs creation of the sun
do you think rap lyrics are better or worse now	i believe they are worse and should rap about better topics
and the 49ers	they were stacked
exactly anything from before we were born	some of them were okay especially those old films they show late at night on the local channels
i prefer jeans or pants at night i usually like a nice pair of dark jeans made by seven jeans or paige brand	i love those brands too i like the length on them since im kind of tall
i switched back and forth at first i was crazy for paul	yeah he was so cute but i had a huge crush on john
well it is a little known fact too	yeah
75	really  thats a lot of runs
but its more progressive too	thats true

if only he had made them the team would have won the game	yeah he was like hitting the rim and they bounced off
man i do not understand why thriller movies are called thrillers	why do you not get it
whatever is most common	for him probably a bbb tuba try a st petersburg 202n its a bit under 4000
you mean that really old batman movie with michael keaton in it	yes its got a great batman with jack nicholson as the joker and its cool
yes i remember pretty good ship for a hunk of junk	ha ha thats right it always seemed to perform well under pressure
he live in the neighborhood of asian	whats the big deal about it
yes she really pulled it out for the movie	i like aronofsky but always darker material
money isnt everything plenty of lowbudget films look good	like what name one
exactly they still have time to right the ship	we are only roughly 40 games in and they are hovering at the 500 mark
i love the beatles music so much	it is timeless
i beg t differ	well we shall differ then

lets listen to it now here i have it saved on my phone i think that you will love miranda lambert	okay turn it on and well give it a listen
really why george he didnt really get to do many songs with the beatles	but the ones he did get to make were my favorites especially something

in the case of george lucas when he was making the first star wars it was very true his wife was a very talented film editor	she worked on his film for him probably for free

chris pratt and vin diesel is in it	yes it looks even more exciting than the first one was
in all honesty wouldnt every song she has ever sung relate to something like that	very funny
i too favor the sea hawks for the superbowl	as long as it is not the bills the cowboys or the patriots i will be happy
do you think the dodgers are good	they have only one pitcher and justin turner just got hurt
sure what are they	the emerald forest raiders of the lost ark and romancing the stone
i dont think they will the actors are getting to old	maybe they can do a spinoff with new actors
hey have you ever heard of chiptune music	chiptune isnt that like electronic

maybe when the next movie comes out with superman or the suicide squad when can go to the movies togather	i am all in just give me a call

anything more specific	i guess it just describes my life best

i think hes a better overall player	hes a better passer and hes a bigger guy
oh really what is it	its actually antman

their general manager position is currently vacant	they used to be called the dallas texans
did you see moana	yes my kids make me watch it at least a couple times a week

its a shame he didnt win an award for it	thats what i hear
no who was in it	it starred jessica alba
very funny would you watch it again	no  once you know the surprise its boring
of course i think so that is why i own it	well you have good taste in music
i hope they dont go down that road again	i thought it was cool
lionel barrymore cedrick hardwicke and bobs watson played the little boy	what was it about
yea it really is all about the money	on the positive side musicians are still at least pretending to be legitimate artists

yeah that was confusing	there wasnt a sense of setting in it just a safe rehash
you know it	i like the tassel on it it makes the bag look fun

well no of course not but i wasnt expecting george hardy either	dont be so hard on poor george the dentist

i think they are decent	they are i dont see them winning any title though
green bay packers	packers i dont like green bay

ewww shes annoying  i dont care for her	i think shes a good singer  have you heard her hit the high notes in firework

all i can say is this wow  gal gadot knocked it out of the park	thats my dream girl right there
like i just said its fantastic if you get the chance definitely watch it	i actually think its on netflix well i know what im doing tonight
there was also much less backing vocals by kim deal on that album which was a staple of pixies music	theres some of that but yeah she sing much less on that album her bass parts are still prominent and wonderful though
okay okay	man sorry you had to listen to it though
really it seems like the first one just came out	i know but it really was a great movie the voice acting by jason bateman and ginnifer goodwin was great
who else do you think deserves recognition as a head coach	bruce arians cardinals have been struggling the last couple of years but they came awfully close to their goal a couple seasons back
have you seen the skeleton key	i dont think i have what is it about

so in other words to say he is a bust would be to make a correct even if incomplete statement	insofar as being both correct and incorrect at the same time sure i mean you cant choose to be one or the other if you make one statement you must acknowledge the other
no it is true	their is plenty of good new rock
the fate of the furious was not only great action but great comedy as well	all around balanced i do hope they make more movies in the furious franchise i love to see more of dom letty and hobbs and maybe more of deckard as well
why is that	because he tried to take the spotlight from dom
who is your favorite character	that has to be darth vader
letang might be one of the best defense men in the leauge	he certainly is and can score on whim
the helmets cost around 1000 and i think the jersey is  about 200  and pants 100	then you have all the other extras
you mean to say you dont like diannos songs like charlotte the harlot those are cult classics too	yes but when you hear dickinson do his versions of those songs in concert the difference is tremendous
the deluxe edition of california was even better than california itself	agreed the collection of songs on there were really strong

i had a crush on donald oconnor	not gene kelly
they are pretty good	do you like them

you know there are resources like that you can find online	that would help me a ton
it was called giant	with elizabeth taylor
definitely  what was your favorite movie in the series	honestly i really enjoyed the goblet of fire the most  i thought the storyline with the game was really intriguing
divide its really good i promise	would i know any of the songs on it
like techo type stuff	yes i like spinning records channel on youtube
oh of course  one of the greatest songs ever made	i mean come on  dont you just always sing but im free free faaalin

oh okay i got it	you should hear their latest album
did you see the golden state warriors game on saturday	yeah they are looking tough
did you know that the disney movie cinderella was released in 1950	i knew it was a while ago but not that long
you listening to any good music right now	yeah have you ever heard of 311
have you heard perfect illusion	not yet will look for it when i head to the music store later
what about harden hes the mvp and he cant make your top 5	first hes not the mvp its westbrook second his stats are inflated because of the system
ive got a question for you  its about disney	you have my undivided attention now  whats your question
im totally down to watch it do we get to throw stuff at your tv though	uhhh absolutely not please dont break my tv
yes he deserves so many awards for his characters	yes he also produces movies too hes very smart
well the only suggestion i have left is that we could find a good radio station	i bet we could find something fitting maybe something contemporary
yep it was a huge thing years ago	how did the nfl catch onto them
great do you have a favorite kind	all of them really
yeah ive been immersing myself in his music lately it is so sad that there wont be any more hits from such a great artist the man will always be a legend in the world of rock	yeah but at least we have such a large bank of his hits to enjoy that powerhouse voice will live on forever
one of my favorites too	he sometimes plays it slow and sometimes fast
i liked that part as well i thought it was a good element to spice things up for the movie	i liked the costume the most it was pretty good
did you see tonights met game	i cant believe they almost blew it
hey im so old i remember the advent of punk music in america	no kidding that is old did you listen to sid vicious and stuff
some guys get no run support	like cole hamels
oh i loved nirvana i liked hole too with his wife courtney love	thats surprising i know a lot of fans blamed her for his death
my aunt is having a birthday party for her dog and wants to play dog music	oh ok
what bands do you like	i like yaz eurymthmics is my favorite though what about you
think of something animated	i think it varies trolls is a great movie though
yeah jack and jill was super lame	the movie neighbors was super funny
i know i love him	i just recently watched him in masterminds  i thought he was good in that
i thought rogue one was fantastic myself why didnt you like it	i just thought there was way too much death it was so sad at the end
my daughter was into it for a while when she was young	was it any good
she must have a really busy life	it seems that way always travelling and writing music
yes i just dont get how they can make such a bold statement	the new star wars movies wouldnt even exist if the old ones werent made first
another one of my favorites	nice talking to you
yes but the first single that was released was called green light  i think you would like that one	can i dance to it
yes the plot is pretty thick on this one jimmy stewart is a retired photographer who has broken his leg and is stuck in his apartment	what it all takes place in one location
im sure overseas fans feel like they dont know when they would get a chance to see her again so thats why they risk it	they must be really devoted ariana grande fans to take the risk though
yeah we will just have to see about that when do they play	the packers first game is september 10 and they are playing against the seahawks
lets talk about music	okay that sounds good
well their abbey road album is quite famous	oh yeah ive seen the cover of them all crossing the street
have you heard of the band spoon	yes i listen to them occasionally they come up on my pandora stations a lot
it certainly is  the movie is even worse in how they try and fight it and restore humanity	i just cant wrap my head around why any serious actor would think this was a good idea
of course like you even said theyre super underrated	must be really good if youre giving them this high praise
does that have some deep meaning about the afterlife or angels or some ethereal plane	i dont know maybe his ex girlfriend picked out the satin sheets and he is till paying them off

the seahawks	are you serious right now

but they broke up so they dont count	yes they do one of my favorite songs was story of my life
what is the physics behind pixie dust	you mean how does it work
yeah true  he really helped the cowboys a lot	i was surprised that kc let go of john dorsey i wonder what caused that
it was because a bunch of the marvel creators were boasting about how this was going to be the best trailer ever and it got the fans really curious	i wonder what the box office records will be when the film comes out in november
agreed all those triple doubles its insane	im actually trying to get tickets to an okc game next week would you want me to get you a ticket
have you seen any independent movies recently	i saw john dies at the end
a few songs like sexyback	yeah thats also a good song
there was art blakey and the jazz messengers	were they pretty big
so what all did you get for your birthday	i got a lot of cds that i have been wanting
yeah kind of ironic that they built this new stadium to be closer to the majority of their fans and yet they are playing so poorly if that causes less people to show up it will be kind of funny	like they made that move for nothing
for sure its from the sunset tree a great album	whats their latest album
i think so his films are normally quite good so i have high expectations	danny boyle is good did you watch slumdog millionaire
you think	its a possibility
i dont think he is going to perform well	i think so he just got paid
oh yeah what is your favorite album by them	i really love the joshua tree did you know that they have a tour for the 30th anniversary
that would be so much better	pretty much it would
they become the target of the dollmakers possessed creation annabelle	how can you be scared of a doll it is just a doll hit it

hey whats your opinion on j crews new spring catalog	well i did see a few things i liked but i havent shopped at j crew for awhile now

underground	yeah you know lesser known
they had a blast not my favorite disney movie but definitely worth seeing	i thought so too it was a lot of fun
hey bill wanna catch the falcons pre season game next weekend	thatd be great what time
i just watched the hateful eight	how did you find it
you know of this odd type of rap	what type is it and how is it odd
i think so too	i mean your shoulders and parts of your chest are exposed to the cold
i think you could say the film was pretty good	for the time period yes
yes and maiden is one of the best	i agree
i still love the music and all but the message is sort of not my style anymore	what do you mean
i used to be unfamiliar but ive been listening to it more recently and its growing on me	really are you going to clubs or something
i admire him and i think hes a great coach but i cant cheer for his team	its like they dont need cheering for
i think beiber is pretty great	i need you to stop talking hes terrible
they have had some serious controversy huh	yeah it seems like every season some report about their locker room comes out
maybe we can listen to some together i want to know what they sound like now	okay that sounds fun
it sure is whoopi is great in her starring role	whoopi who is whoopi
what do you mean	in the early 1980s casio started releasing cheap synthesizers which were easy to obtain
dont worry hon its just a little ozzy	youd be on the couch for sure
im from new york i like the knicks i wish i could go to madison square garden	is that where the kicks play

its reallly good you should check it out	i loved ellen degeneres as dory in finding nemo i bet id love finding dory
whats your favorite disney song	are you serious  there are so many
she snuck out of the house to go into the village and nobody noticed	didnt the guards find her  isnt that why they went into the city
who is the top prospect for penn state this year	im not sure but its going to be an awesome season
she is definitely the star of the movie	oh yeah especially the pie scene and her scenes celia
who is the other singer from one direction that has solos	liam payne has a pretty catchy new song called strip that down
i loved every actors part in it	i think marlon brando did better than anyone
i love radiohead	radiohead is amazing their music and their values
my favorite is probably galway girl i do like them all very much though	me too are you ready for taylor swifts next album to come out
yeah especially anything having to do with politics	oh i actually did see one recently about north korea
like tebow	kaep is waaaay better than tebow
his first name is spelled daughn not don	his albums selling for 100 on amazon ive got to add that to my list
mostly they play the old movies like snow white and sleeping beauty	ugh sleeping beauty is terrible
i was sad at that part and worried they were going to kill et	what a great ending when you think about it the ending was happy but sad at the same time
johnson said it isnt really addressed too much but it may be a red herring	just say shes lukes daughter already
i believe she did they also made another track together too	what was it called it was called video phone
i am way above impressed	well then let me hear it
i completely understand sbtrkt and sampha were made for eachother	i wish theyd keep working together everything they do is gold
whatever dude well see whos laughing at the end of the season	yes we will
gotcha  pure sci fi stuff though	thats true  just so different from the other alien movies
hey it was good you cant blame me for liking something more modern	i guess but cmon what bout revenge
cool ive seen documentaries on him he looks like a cool guy in real life	yeah ive met him before and he was really nice
what is it about their music that makes them superior to metallica for you	well theyre a lot more consistent and never watered down their sound for commercial appeal
like what	he directed cacoon
2014	yes thats kind of recent
i have some still today that will always be my favorite the body guard the romance love and music was off the hook	what does off the hook mean does it mean cool
its obviously served them well financially if they keep making movies on the topic	the funny thing is that for me i dont even find the concept that cool
no but players in those games arent frequently receiving head injuries	would you say football players receive more head injuries than boxers
i saw gone girl	i read the book but did not see the movie
i love that song it is so relaxing	yes i think paul wrote more songs than john but the ones john wrote were just so magical
im going to the studio today	how nice have you heard that popular song on the radio
tom brady is ancient but he still finds a way to win	they can never put a hand on him
hey do you think anyone can beat new england this year	i think they will lose a couple games
yea he looked so weird in that movie	whats funny is that is how things were back then
same for me as well	what franchise is your favorite
monday at five oclock	are you gonna bring your kids
i did too i also liked champagne high	what made you think of them
whats your preferred genre of music	i guess im into pop music above all other types
everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food	it wasnt funny at all just creepy
yes then he came out only in a thong	thats so rock and roll
i agree	films dont take risks anymore thats what made the original ghostbusters so great it was a niche movie that hit it big
ah right they were pretty awesome	i still hear their stuff on some of the sirius xm channels
i agree onehundred percent	what else even was there on that album no great great hits
this is a different style the way they are riding this beat	yeah its like they are ahead of it or something
so what did you think of attack of the clones	im a little so so on it  what about you
i agree  her songs have a deep meaning and are encouraging and joe nichols  if nobody believed in me	that is the type of songs i love to hear  we dont need more drinking songs we need good morals in songs
there was sean astin	and also josh brolin
he was pretty creative	it was hard to watch him eating the potatoes and getting low on them
so it wasnt really a scary thriller	not really  tom hanks was able to project that tech entrepreneur thing very well
wow who killed him	it was a crazy fan  mark david chapman i think
im the same way ill listen to anything from classical to rap music	i dont usually listen to the radio that much though
that reminds me of the good old days	thats why i keep it around
i think joe montana was great under pressure and at orchestrating comebacks	he had jerry rice to throw too maybe too easy
it would be great to see a team that hardly ever wins go out there and win it all one season	yeah that would almost make me want to watch football
who is best player in the nfl	that is hard there are a lot of good players
everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food	it wasnt funny at all just creepy
willem dafoe matt damon tian jing	i know of matt damon and i think he is a good actor you said the special effect were good
a conspiracy theory about how lady gaga killed lina morgana	what
so unless you have seen the movie you wouldnt get the referance	exactly you should go watch it it is just as good as split
theyre a band the lead singer has a wicked nice voice	oh cool we usually share the same taste so ill check it out
well he meets an alien in a bar	haha wow this is the weirdest movie i have heard of
he was definitely enlightened	yeah but he needed jerry man to make the music and sing the lyrics
so are you in	yeah that sounds like fun do i need to bring anything special
yeah its really a great song of love and memory so poignant for a pop song	mmmhmm it also has the right tempo and mood for a service like that what would you go with
what about bruno mars	he is good but i think taylor is the best
have you ever listened to perry como	believe it or notyes i have
i do love the shark tank though its got a great bar	too bad its closed lets go over to the high life
no man hes not in it its different	hes not so they rebooted another reboot like spiderman
me too why you say it was better	because it was more realistic it had me thinking about that bank robbery out there in california some years back
that was back when pixar was basically unknown	and it put them on the map
well later that year it was halloween and i didnt have anything to watch so i thought id rent a couple films one was lights out the other was the conjuring 2	how did that go
im sure they will they usually win one and loose the other against the patriots	who do you think will be in the superbowl this year
it is really sad when the mother deer dies	death is just part of life i guess
i also like god nlessed the broken road	thats such a classic love song
they also had that selftitled album just called janes addiction it wasnt really an album though because it was a collection of demos and live songs	they were pretty popular locally before they signed to warner bros records
remember early in russell wilsons career when he used to go down field and lead block for marshawn lynch	he still tries to run down field and block for his guys i love the attitude but its not exactly something i want to see my franchise qb doing
did you see what she was wearing yesterday	yeah it was really tacky who wears a skirt with shoes like those
i love rock music the sort of avenged 7x 55dp bfmv the beatles the doors	wow thats quite some variety
uh huh i has no idead what you mean by that	i mean i might listen to 80s glam rock one day then symphonic rock later that same day followed by country western music next
youre crazy	dont foget
they have three albums so far but they are working on their fourth album these days	how would you rate their albums from best to worst
when do you think she got started in music	she got started in 2001
im anxious to know where this sport came from do you know where it was first played	in the 18th century in england
strike  you were saying	just wait  hell get a piece of it and itll get him on base if not get the dodgers a run
new orleans is putting out some great stuff	galactic is always good but i dont know if they have a new album
im in the mood for a romantic comedy something simple and sweet would you recommend the wedding planner	honestly not really unless youre a really big jennifer lopez fan
i heard it was coming our next year so theres still a bit of time left	i liked black panther´s introduction in the las captain america movie
for someone who likes disney what would you recommend	recommend
the  did really well in the draft	did they get some good picks
do you have a favorite	one of my all time favorite movies is the mask
i definitely love some hiphop	yeah nicki minaj is one of the best

whos the king of rock and roll	elvisof course
isnt that witih mila kunez	yea shes a dancer in that movie
thats a good choice you get to be queen and you get cool powers who would you pick	i would pick the genie from aladdin
did you like the chances that were made to the star wars films	i dont mind them but the original should be out there still
dang thats a lot older than the other guys on the team	true but that skill level though
well it looks terrible	its not just that they are cutting their jeans apart
did you see katy perry in maison margiela the red was totally shocking because the was so much of it	yeah she almost looked like a ghost and flamigo dancer had a baby im not sure that was winner but i did  like the boldness of the red
oh really did you hear anything from a moon shaped pool	i watched one of the videos it seemed pretty cool and similar to their earlier stuff
youre talking deathly hallows part 2 right	yeah  part 1 was super boring
yeah that was kind weird what a messed up world	i know but what an action packed series
8 out of 10 stars so that is very healthy for a rating	we should go see it
well apparently not at all	that makes me love star wars franchise even more the force is strong
i think the funniest character in that movie is clifford	its so hilarious how uptight he is
well we will have to see at the end of the season	indeed we will
john glenn trusted her numbers	thats amazing
what do they sound like	most of their songs are just acoustic guitars and gentle singing
i think its hard to say i think brady had the better team	i think brady was the better player
yeah a little but other than that nothing to brag about	guess thats why i dont know that movie
its lady gaga what do you think	okay ill take your word for it huh this is good
think dallas will win the division again this year	no actually im picking another team
right that song is creepy	it is i love all the other songs except that one
now were talking	haha  i knew that would work
i guess you are right it is more varied	most easily
do you remember when disney made the hercules movie	the cartoon  yeah
exactly i can only remember gold digger being played on the radio and that was a long time ago	its been over a decade since it was released
i watch it still and i am 30	it must be good then
oh i like that  what are your favorite bands	i dont know  i like the eagles queen a lot of stuff
yeah agree	oh wait didnt beck win something that year
i think it was border line but im not 100 sure	for me it was holiday  and now anytime i hear the song i think of how it got butchered by adam sandler in the wedding singer
who is the main character	tina caspary she is not in much else but she is amazing in this movie
wow thats a shocker	i mean it was a ride what more can you do
well what are some of their songs	where the streets have no name with or without you sunday bloody sunday
no i just couldnt stand to be bored that long	i thought it was better than the first one but the cartoon is better
when was that released	it was released in november 2014
oh yeah and what is more the lead singer trent reznor is really a musical genious	what makes you say that
lots of stealing	did you see the game with boston
montana didnt lose any	and didnt get to as many
i saw the new wonder woman movie last night	oh yeah  what did you think
i just watched this new movie with big worm in it	you mean big worm from friday
hmmm  probably oasis	really oasis
did you hear about the latest movie news lately	i did i heard about brad pitts new movie with tommy lee jones
i hope that they have a good season  roethlisberger is a great quarterback	yeah im hopeful that this will be a good year  bell had a descent rushing record last year
queen specifically	i think i have heard of them
hey	you ever see super troopers
they plan such interesting plays ive never seen before	thats cool
yes but in a warmer climate	fnny but i dont think it works that way
it is good way to spend the time	enough with the jokes
one name to watch for	rueben foster hes a beast and will be droy i cant believe we got him at the end of round 1 by the end of the season you will see a lot of foster jerseys around levis guaranteed
hey who are some of your favorite female singers	well let me think i know barbara streisand was one of my fathers favorites
ill make sure to pour out a 40 for him after i go to the liquor store rest in peace to the legend	totally man come over well have a couple beers and listen to some of his music in his honor
you have to see it in 3d it was a  much better experience than standard	you went to see it twice
yes he did	right now was a big hit
really  i cant see that at all	okay well we will see  at least a better choice then the browns you chose
well yeah i mean its what he is good at	whats your favorite song by him
me to even though her new songs are good as well	i agree she hardly ever delivers a bad song
the rose bowl	who did the halftime show
yes tokyo drift is my favorite movie in that series how about you	i like the second movie thats where they showed the silver r34
game 3 of the series is pretty big one	yeah with the spurs being down 02 in the series this one was cruicial for them
oh ill definitely will where can i find the song again	just look it up on youtube
niki caro directed it i think shes a fantastic director and making a come up in the industry	oh i like her works she directed that kevin costner movie mcfarland usa and also north country starring charlize theron
did you enjoy it	i quite did
do you also prefer that era of batman films	i think part of the child me does but i do think the nolan batman films are stronger overall
did you know that alice cooper is coming out with a new album next month	i havent heard that
yeah that would be good	the effects look good in the new wonder woman movie though
check check can you hear me over their	yeah i can hear you fine man
good concept though	yeah
oh ive seen that episode but dont remember his name coming up	ok if youve seen candyman that is his work
whats your favorite video by lady gaga	if i have to choose one it would be bad romance how about you
he had so many famous lines and the plot was fantastic	wow i should watch it again then its been so long
what do you mean	his lyrics wouldnt be able to hold up
did you see tool last night	they were in town i had no idea

it was and the high pony was a great choice	i loved that she paired the high pony with diamond drop earrings
that mustve made a lot of people mad	it did for a while but jerry jones hired jimmy johnson and they started winning
well thats an interesting rivalry	the lombardi trophies are created by tiffany  co theyre said to be worth between 25000 to 300000
sure	i was watching trailers on youtube and found the pet was a movie from a few decades ago that was remade last year and it looks like a pretty intense psychological thriller there was actually a surprising amount of horror movies that received little to no recognition that looked really good
right and then the raiders stunk it up were terrible for the last 1015 years and the broncos moved on	add in the free agency thing and its no longer a league that has rivalries in the true sense
it details all of the trials wonder woman aka diana princess of the amazons goes through on her attempts to save the worlds	sounds like a great blockbuster superhero movie
yep and dallas top receiver only had 66 receiving yards	thats crazy what was the final score if you remember
what have you been listening to lately	ive been feeling a little nostalgic lately so ive been listening to a lot of singersong writer stuff that kind of reminds me of home
give me two reasons why theyre better than the original films i bet you cant	i didnt say they were better just that they were great ill give you two factors that are improvements over the originals though number one the cgi effect allowed for more creatures more beautiful landscapes more action than ever before
but you can appreciate the work and detail that was put into the movie right	yeah i can  honestly i just really wanted lost in translation to win  i thought it was much more engaging
yeah i think he focuses more on that	a lot of rapper seem to do this
haha love it honestly i love oldies music too	me too like 50s rock n roll stuff

because every second of it is incredible and worth the trouble	what in the world is so good about them

defiantly i cant wait to see it	same here it takes place after the last movie right
were you disappointed that little anakin skywalker turned out to be darth vader	yes because he started out as a cute kid with a happy personality

i want to see the eagles vs the redskins	that sounds like a great matchup

we had 5 wins last season	i know not the best record still you gonna miss a day of tailgating

for sure and some of the scenes they share are funny too	are you talking about the classic lion king

what kind of movies do you like action comedy drama or romance	i like action comedy drama but especially horror some romance are okay
where did you hear that this was the most popular song	i read it in billboard
yes but in a good way  this was just silly  also ben affleck is a terrible batman  and the batsuit looked like a suit of armor  theres no way someone could jump from buildings in that	oh wow that does sound awful  should i see it just to laugh at it
to me it felt more like a novelty album than anything else	what do you mean a novelty album
me either  its on my watch list	yeah i watch it when it comes out on cable or netflix
he is will he win the mvp	maybe
hi	want to talk about movies
the guy who played goose was a roommate of mel gibsons in film school	thats cool
yeah the songs take a hit	in favor for the stories
how are your diamondbacks doing	they lost 2 of 3 to colorado in denver over the weekend still in second place but now 2 and a half games back

he can still sing great	hes got to be close to 70 too dont you think
fine what about gameplay annoys you the most	icing the kicker
what about the part of the breakfast when everyone drank the frobscottle	oh that was the funniest and most disgusting part of the movie  i laughed until i cried

oh my goodness i cried so much it was a great representation of what depression feels like	and i loved how they validated both the importance of joy and sadness together
like who though	the killers and the red hot chili peppers still get airplay
stop it	but your annoying

so when they are retired in the 60s after working in hollywood 40 or 50 years marketing people started making the calls  about what films got made and they saw that kids were driving the box office so they brought in by two young directors to appeal to them	that sounds about right there were suddenly a lot of new big shot directors in the 70s martin scorsese steven spielberg george lucas francis ford coppola
they can only improve nowright	yeah i cant imagine how they can play worse
hopkins is retired from doing the psychic thing but an investigator convinces him to take on a very difficult case it turns out that the perpetrator is a very powerful psychic as well	i see so it becomes a battle of psychics pitted against eachother
he did some crazy things to those soldiers	yes they didnt know who they were messing with
i think i would rather rewatch prestige to prisoners	i think it makes for a more enjoyable rewatch once you know the end
oh heck yeah that would be cool	i want to know her origin story you know
yep and youre likely going to have a lot of stories to tell	yes and that seems like an uncreative way to make movies
your favorite actor from that movie	clint eastwood
do you remember clue	wasnt that in the mid 80s
really im surprised i thought for sure youd be against it	youd think that but theres nothing wrong with those guys getting out there with someone else

i think it came out toward the end of may honestly id still go see it in the theaters and then buy it on dvd when its available the theater experience is like no other	yes i suppose you do get more of the surround sound and quality picture in the theaters
yeah a mix of drama and science fiction kind of like donnie darko	i see and im going to guess its super weird too
who knows  it was a great season regardless	i agree
thats true i remember after i saw jaws every time i went into the ocean i was expecting to be eaten	thats what directors and writers are counting on that most people already have that fear
how can it sound like that	well the tempo stays consistent its just the amount they play gets shorter each time and the window between soundings gets shorter too
so i guess the 80s was more brit pop	yeah i would come to that conclusion

we will see dallas does have a pretty good line any half decent back can get a 1000 yard season runnning behind them	speaking of good lines lynch to oakland might be pretty good to watch

which of the characters is your favorite	my favorite is hermione for sure and emma watson does such an excellent job portraying her
the packers	ah thats too bad

it is pretty weirdi had a hard time with it too  any others	yes lion it was a real feel good movie
yeah that never gets old to me	to me it does
ha no not at all he had to make that connection for me	yeah i can see how one might get fixated on the rum part
i wouldnt go that far then again i havent been able to really pay attention to the music	i think its reasonable the real thing was mostly written with chuck moseley in mind mike patton strolled in with basically a completed album and sang the words in front of him
beyond injury it all depends on if rodgers continues to perform well	he improved a lot from 2015 to 2016
i still think they cheat	who cheat

i still like just dance it makes me want to dance	i miss her old stuff but i like anything she makes too

youre nuts the kings are by far the best they will win the cup easily	thats what you said about the capitols last year and they were out in the first round
drowning is probably her most popular but gemini feed is the latest one its pretty popular too	oh yeah of course ive heard of her i just forgot who she was
i think fripp is crazy to take down his albums when people post them to youtube i totally think people are more likely to buy them if they get to hear them its not like you get introduced to king crimson randomly	i agree i have sent links to their albums to people and they have told me that they actually went ahead and bought them
yes but i plan on going to see it the second week of june	i will like to go with you if it ok with you
everyone got their moment to shine but spiderman was probably the crowning glory of the movie	i really like the new peter parker im looking forward to the next spiderman movie

boy george makeup was so coolhe almost looks like a girl	yeah i know but i loved his music
wow did you get season tickets again	of course  every year for 10 years

what is your favorite disney movie	i love beauty and the beast
i just dont want to see the patriots again	i dont either unfortunately theyre the top ranked team still in the power rankings
they tried they stopped deliveries to 110 customers but 167 were still sent out	people pay good money for those so they wuld be upset if they were misled about them
he was a tremendous actor in that movie	he was amazing you can tell he really absorbed that character
who do you think is the worst team in the league	browns the cleveland browns
who is your favorite fashion designer	i really love alexander mcqueen
wow those are some awesome bands i used to love the goo dolls	i still think they are great
yeah i wonder why he covered it	i dont know either
they did it very well though	do we know which pixar got the best rating
that doesnt sound that good	trust me it is and also check out cant hold us and same love
what i really appreciated is how much detail they put into the milenium falcon interior to be sure it matched with the interiors from the original movies	if you didnt know any better you might think that they were using the exact same set for it as they did in the original trilogy
i thought it was justin bieber	wow you were way off
must of been if you remember seeing it so long ago when you were young	think that is true of only a couple other movies
so you like her early stuff	i also like her first songs
oh okay cool  yeah i enjoy that as well	it is great
me neither way too fake	well have to catch a movie together sometimes
so which ones did you like	i guess i liked thriller and man in the mirror and bad
both but feel free to give either one a try	okay the best batman is definitely in the original television series
they seem to make a billion dollars on average so yes someone must like them	theyre okay theyre not good but theyre not horrible
yeah sometimes it is very hard to understand rap music	same goes for heavy metal music i can never understand what they are saying
it sounds like a really sad song	i guess you could call it sad i would personally say it was not so much sad for me it just had a lot of deep meaning
yea but they cant see the crocodile they dont even know if its still there	so what they still know its a crocodile
yeah itd be fun	let it go
when do you want to go	no time like the present i guess
without stability at the qb position i think i agree that green bay is winning the nfc north	in the end always bet on the quarterback

oh i want to see that it seems funny	yeah it was funny it is more for guys though
oh i love pink too	what song
i feel that way about the puns in breakfast	i know what you mean i miss the old newsboys

hello how are you doing this afternoon	i am good me and my daughter are getting ready to watch a movie
what do you like about them	they had lyrics which had deep meaning but the songs were also easy on the ears
the washington redskins are all hypepreseason they are great then once the season starts they fall apart	yeah their players are either on or off no consistency there at all
i forgot he won best actor for that film yes he did deserve it he was terrifying	the movie was already brilliantly written and he brought it to life
right it was in that movie it is a great piece of music that is a little crazy	a little crazy is what i like
its funny how music is such a signifier of lifestyle and personality	yeah especially with a band like the grateful dead
i loved that too even though it was released in 1955 its still one of the best in my opinion	jock is the cutest he cracks me up the way he skips and buries his bones
yeah sure which one were you thinking	i really like old dominion
in the new harry potter movie some of the actors are being changed	they are
terrelle pryor is going to be an elite wr in this league	he had a breakout year last year for sure
yes up in the nosebleeds but the atmosphere was awesome	thats amazing especially to be there for a playoff game
it sure was and it did real well on the charts  its been nice talking to you about this legendary band	definitely i appreciate all the knowledge you provided
do you think the latest beauty and the beast will be enjoyed by children today	thats hard to say but if i had to bet i would say they would enjoy the original better
is he from the united states	he is he is from a town called clarksdale
yea the way they slowmotion dodged bullets was really cool	yea it was
do you like any of the harry potter movies	i do but only the first and second they were too complicated after that
i saw that interview too it was strange to see her without her costume	she looks pretty ordinary doesnt she but man that voice
that is amazing ill have to look up that play	it was such an impossible play that its been named the immaculate reception
are you serious who in the nfc could actually beat the patriots	oh so you automatically think the patiots will be the afc champion
i liked it a lot it felt like they really stuck to the story of nwa	i heard they had to cut a lot of stuff out of the movie
honestly there werent too many scenes in the movie	it was very detailed though
do you think rayne prescott can replace romo	he did a great job last season
good call	i gotta run though
they loved it	man that movie takes me back
yuck ive never been a fan i cant deal with guys that use more hairspray than i do	ha true i guess ive always kind of like the alternative groups i was into nirvana and pearl jam when they made it to east coast
yesshe was an established actress	max von snydow played the priest right
actually theres 7 teams that have that no team has won 3 in a row though	oh that fact is interesting i thought the number was way smaller
i think the son really wanted to know who his father really was he was trying to find the truth about him	i cant remember who were the actors in it
thats a good point	and julio jones can be a stud but sometimes i think his hands are a little bit suspect
what do you mean	hes more athletic and has a stronger arm
what abut the transformers that was a good series	the first one was pretty good but then hollywood decided to make all those sequels
olaf is pretty great but i think my favorite is kristoff	oh i love him hes definitely better than hans
yea those were the days  what are some of you favorite summertime songs from back then	california girls funfunfun a summer song even songs like a summer place and summertime summertime
i know but hes my favorite	what did oyu think of batman v superman
at least he is successful at michigan  he was a hell of an nfl coach	they went to the superbowl a few years after he joined the league
that song was awesome	yep were no longer friends
what do you think of coach	coach is the best
what was the other zombie movie	it was the maze runner the scorch trials
i would tend to agree theres exceptions but they just dont make them like they used to	yeah give me bad company reo speedwagon and kansas over modern stuff anyday
what is another song of his	bad billie jean and many more
ya she is less popular but i think a great actress i liked her in the whispers tv show	she was a lso in house of cards but i like her best in cabin in the woods
whats your favorite movie of the year	good question i dont even know
yeah that carlos santana song maria maria	ah yeah i remember that now
he also had 10 rebounds	they really came back at the end of the game
out of will ferrell movies do you prefer the anchorman movies or step brothers	oh thats a tough one they are all so good
i wonder if any of it is true	im sure it is
true i think they may have helped her be accepted as both singer and actor	ya it is hard because once the public views you one way very hard to change that molded vision
i know	so where is stacy now
be our guest be our guest put our service to the test	what are you talking about
whats up	nothing much
yes it really is	did sand blow into your tent
what team is he on	the patriots
yeah true but what kind of movie do you least like to see in theaters	probably cartoons just doesnt do anything for me
ive never been interested in going to minnesota so i dont think i should go	were you planning on actually going to the game or youre going to sightsee
nothing its just that i find certain movies in it to be surprising	why what do you find so surprising
yeah and the machine gun leg on his girlfriend was pretty cool too	ironic that they needed to get to mexico the whole time
they both have rockin teams	i know
was patrick stuart in one of the superhero movies	duh he was in xmen hes professor x
still i think theyre off to a great start after tanking 3 years ago and they have all th ose draft picks including 1	wow really  that is crazy
goldie hawn played schumers mom so i was hoping it would be better	yeah i would think goldie hawn would make it good
yeah  the robot was also kind of styled like her	i dont even know what to say to that
i agree i loved the music in it i think lin manuel miranda did really good with the songs	yea did you hear he was going to be in the new mary poppins movie
thats true until jarrod dysons singled to score danny valencia from 2nd base for seattle	heystill more innings to be played we can come back
i think so and i like seeing the cast return	yeah that is always fun
what do you think about jungle book	it was such a brilliant movie the visuals are insanely good
okay ill let you know what i think after i hear the songs	let me know if you like them ive got a bunch to recommend to you
yeah it definitely made me feel sad at parts  i felt bad for the women in the movie	they were definitely degraded a lot  that part was discouraging
i believe this will be big bens year dont you think	i also believe he deserves one more ring
that would be so cute they could have moanas journey with moui	i have to say hei hei was one of my favorite side kick characters
they have not been good since culpepper	dont forget carter and moss
youre right the last song i heard by him was shining but that was on dj khaleds new album and it featured beyoncé	oh i will listen to anything featuring beyoncé
have you ever see crocodile dundee	waaay back in the day
how about the legendary prince did you like him	not a whole lot but definitely liked some of his songs
he is music prodigy he can play many instruments	oh that is strange i have never heard of him
well i wasnt a huge fan until i became an adult	really that is weird
have you heard of the black keys	yes of course
what is your favorite song now	youve got to hide your love away i love the way he sings it and it makes me think about what he was going through publicly at the time
well if they make it back to the series they might not be seeing the cubs this year	nope they look lost after last year
when ursala takes her voice and those green hands come out its pretty creepy	oh yah i tottally remember now he used to look away at that part
you know kind of hippie music i guess you would call it	oh okay  the grateful dead
hey are you looking forward to the upcoming nfl season	yes miss watching some football
i wish i could have went to it	me too i had read that the sound equipment went out when they started the show
and they have to eat	yes and
im tired just listening to you talk about her	you were born halfasleep so that doesnt tell me much
he is very talented	yes he is
hey what do you think of adeles music	i think shes got a lot of talent and although i dont want to really admit it i like her music
most different form deadpool i imagine	well it was also rated r so maybe not
yes we do have that one want to watch it	maybe what other movies of his do you have
have you seen any good movies lately	i just saw suicide squad its been on all the time on hbo
mary poppins goes back up into the sky	cool
i can tell you this i did not want ot take a camping trip to the mountains anytime soon after seeing that movie	just dont take any unmarked roads and youll be fine
thats a bet	anything else you like
well i think katy let her dancers go on tour with taylor but had something in their contract where they could come back when katy goes on tour	and they never came back
no i didnt why didnt she do it	she felt it to was too similar to other roles she played
does that mean that you were not a fan of rex ryan	not really i thought he should have done a lot better than what he did
the shining halloween and many others	wow you are braver than i am those movies are too much for me
because i want to figure out who the best comedy actor is	well i guess that could be fun
or old blue chair	thats one of my favorites  that and keg in the closet
so you like green day	they are good i consider them rock and punk rock
then lets go see guardians of the galaxy this weekend	its a date
i really loved their song these are the times also	i can hear the tune in my head but cant remember all the words
well hes an overpaid ceo but i dont have any issue with that	so whats his problem
have you been to a super bowl	no but i would love to go
guy sigsworth and hes worked with a lot of big names bjork even	they were such a perfect duo psychobabble is close to my heart
even after he got hit the first time the second time at bat he killed it again with a double	yeah he sure wasnt intimidated by teheran
project runway is one of the longest running highly acclaimed reality shows out there  tim gunn is such a beloved part of the show and a great mentor to the contestants	i love the thoughtful fashion advice he gives in marie claire
ok so i can probably guess but what is your least favorite star wars movie	definitely the phantom menace
it sounds mostly like jazz but the instrumentation and structure is somewhat rock influenced it seems he is primarily a jazz artist	i havent gotten into jazzrock fusion very much but i do like jazz and progressive rock in general
yeah  they even had mrs babe ruth in there giving out the mvp award to roger at the start of the season	maris was somewhat of an under rated player  he had two really good years at the plate and was just good the rest of the time
it made 470 million	there were some sequels
maybe you should start watchign nascar instead of star wars	wow rude
i love that song	is it very heavy
hopefully he is close to being as good as his brother	yeah his brother is very good
i agree  i thought they were excellent homages to the earlier slasher flicks while bringing something new to the genre	scream also helped resurrect drew barrymores career a bit
that one is great i also love the one moment video	the colors they use in that video are really beautiful
but he doesnt have the championships and now he is coming back from significant injury	well the quarterback situation in houston is likely getting better but its more about the young guys on houstons defense that will influence how much time he sees
who  is your favorite character in aladdin	it would have to be the genie
what are you going to say if the cavs end up choking	lmao get a grip on yourself hell will freeze over before that happens
have you seen seven	is that the thriller with brad pitt and morgan freeman
yea he could be one of them rodgers may be another one but he doesnt run as much	yea those are two good choices griffin was but i do not know what to even consider him anymore
kind of the singing is funny but the story is more serious	how so
that is pretty sweet	he seems superhuman he gets pretty badly injured and is still out there killing people with ease
who is that	why do you keep asking me questions you should watch the movie yourself
yeah me too	whos your favorite rap artist
its not easy to sing and cry at the same time	no but the musical is set in high school and theyre in high school
are you a star wars fan	yes i love the star wars movies
just because a song or artist becomes popular or mainstream doesnt necessarily mean theyll eventually become bad	true but its a longstanding pattern that has happened with many genres and artists
no whats that	ill give you a hint pentatonix pentatones
but like i said good passing quarterbacks can use it to stall defenses	which quarterbacks do you think can use it
who was daniel radcliffe in again	come on you should know this
why would you say that	its basically the same story every time
yep sure do	cool bring it
cool i love robin williams	i know tons of movies with him in it
wouldnt we all and recreate that album cover	exactly everyone knows it
ha that is funny	i can also clearly see the cover art
its really intense though when they are on the clock	yea i can agree to an extent
but they do it so well  the drippy oozy underwater stuff is so cool	im going to wait a couple days to go see it
im not sure what do you think	maybe who knows

last night i could not sleep at all	i know the feeling i stood up until 3 am watching the avengers movie
speaking of stats  esiason has a lot of top ten records in the nfl for quarterbacks	i even remember when he had that terrible concussion from bruce smith
it was down to two trios at the end and then lucas picked the three we all know and love	who were some of the actors under consideration
of course i did korn was awesome	i actually liked them more than slipknot the sound was more relatable to me
nah lets say classic disney animated movies only	hmmm frozen if youre going by the strict definition
to bad we shall never know	i mean take what you got though
why do you like hip hop more	i like it because i can relate more to hip hop artist
okay	what kind of music do you like
yes they would who has the warriors played anyways	the blazers and utah utah is a great young team and the blazers have lillard
what do you think about rock music	i love it it is all that i listen too
yeah especially since none of it made sense	yeah the words he was making up were super funny
i like v and jimin	they work for bit hit entertainment
i have read that they are though they prefer rock music it sounds like	they write some excellent guitar riffs i certainly believe it
i thought the acting was good too especially vivien leigh shes british you know	ya i also heard that she and clark gable didnt like each other
yes  i hope there is something new from him this summer	the record label he owns has been putting out a lot of stuff  just not him

my absolute favorite would be king and lionheart from their debut album my head is an animal	do you have any others
how come we havent heard anything about empire of the sun for a while	they released two vines last year that had a remix of walking on a dream
id say that in order to be folk music the song must have some kind of evolution within an oral tradition	meaning what

excellent definitely check out the title track revolution radio its a stonecold classic and also the threepart track forever now which includes  im freaking out a better way to die and the reprise of somewhere	you got it wow im kind of excited i might even become an actually green day fan after this instead of just an ambivalent tagalong
okay i see which movie was the rock	that was that one about escaping from alcatraz with sean connery and nick cage
wow thats a long wait	yes but it will be worth it
yeah thats a good one did you know a version of that song is used in the soundtrack to the arcade game carnevil	no i did not another of my favorite rob zombie songs is dragula
no way really	yea you should watch it on youtube or something
yeah well each song is about 10 minutes so its 70 minutes of music	wow those are really long songs
i suppose thats similar with a lot of winter sports	well i guess if there was a jamaican bobsled team we could see more hockey programs sprouting up
you might be right but id still like to see it happen the players make the game and this is the best deal for them	maybe but if it makes fans back away it hurts everyone so i dont know man
what do you think we should try next week	what are the choices

i love till i collapse and when im gone	ive listended to those they are really good too
it was so amazing	i havent beem to a game
its amazing how tarkin and leah were completely generated by cg	i didnt realize it until i read about it online  its sad that carrie fisher passed away right after the movie was released
me too and i think a good female buddy comedy would be the perfect way to break our dry spell	awesome its a date hey out of curiosity do you know who directed the movie
exactly another interesting song is we all live in a yellow submarine	tell me about it though it does have a catching rhythm
whats your favorite scene out of all the fast  the furious movies	cant believe youre asking this question but everyones favorite scene should be brian and doms first race
top quality acting with matt damn and leonardo dicaprio	what else
sure that works	musicians are present but dont play any music thats it
so star wars is pretty awesome	i know right whats your favorite one

my favorite song is beauty and the beat	it is by justin beiber
i think id be a great nfl announcer	youd be horrible
i know they are just as cute as everwhos your favorite	zac he was in 1996 and he still is today
that sounds exciting give me more	dodgers reliever ross stripling and bench coach bob geren along with marlins manager don mattingly were all ejected after benches and bullpens emptied in the top of the ninth
look at all the marvel films in the same vein they always tell a story	the old xmen did to an extent
i like phantom too dont worry im just playng	i think masquerade is so underrated
the movie get out was good but not as good as i expected	what are you talking about i thought it was super scary thank goodness chris got away
some people say it was due to sickle cell but i read online that he might have choked on an egg	thats so crazy if that was the case

yesterday is such a beautiful melody i can see that being many peoples favorite	the lyrics are so moving like many beatles songs true lyrical genius
no kidding you can see them on youtube now	ill do that theyre interesting to watch
was it expensive	yeah like almost an entire months rent check but it was worth it
yeah it was nice to see a movie where people were dealing with life struggles that were so realateable	relateable and also so funny i feel like it went unnoticed too when it came out
apparently its a bunch of different recording he did over the years	were you able to hear any of his songs
samuel l jackson is one of my favorite movie actors of all time	which movie do you like him in
i get that but whats wrong with singing about that kind of stuff	well for one its been done to death by every other rapper in the world
it was paul he and lennon are my favorite	i think each beatles had his charm but see those two as the most popular
i think whichever im listening to at the time is my favorite	speaking of beefheart did you ever hear the gtos album i forget exactly whats its called  something like totally deranged but its not that at all
really	yes
what songs did they do	i heard her call my name ill be your mirror and one even called heroin
i think it was funny when the cop came to the door and asked if everything was alright	i know right i started cracking up

well i actually thought that scarlett johansson was very good in it	i like her shes usually pretty good
have you ever seen the land before time	i love it i have the first on dvd
yeah they just need more consistency away from their home confines	well the good thing is they have time
sylvan esso just recently came out with a new album too	awesome i have a lot of homework for tonight
wasnt that the idea	maybe but i thought christina ricci was very believable
so make a graph of it	no its too much work
who was your favorite actor in it	i would have to say samuel jackson
maybe but george michael is right up there and totally pop	its so sad that almost all of that list is dead now
thats true but who decides whats right the government if the law says you have to hurt some people and you know its wrong you have to go against the law to do whats right	thats a good point
i thought it was sad at parts when i watch a comedy i dont like sadness to be a part of it	i see what youre saying
absolutely melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig are fabulous in this actually all the main actresses are	i like that its similar to the original ghostbusters but more modern
that is actually kind of a cute song to be honest	i know right
the song everything she wants is one of my favorite songs	his song called last christmas is pretty good
who is the most famous green bay packer	i would say bart starr

and david hasselhoff is a big music star in austria and germany	suzi quatro played one mean big guitar i remember her 48 crash song years ago whatever that was about
how come they never show that movie that robert dinero made with wesley snipes	oh youre talking about the fan
what team was second most in fans	actually it probably was the browns
not everyone follows them	i agree with that
man you know you right it was messed up how the cops killed jadas brother	he was wrong place wrong time little clown should have never gotten that haircut
why is that	her fighting style her aggressiveness her britishness
no that also takes the fun out of it	it certainly gets involved

then why dont you go on and kiss the girl	because hakuna matata
i dont care what anyone says but the dark knight is my favorite movie of all time	believe it or not but ive never seen that movie is it as good as people say it is
i really did and it really helped that nolan is a master story teller he wrote the screenplay for the dark knight with his brother jonathan nolan	hes brother helped him write the movie thats so cool
then of course there is the famous ax in the door scene	that scene is hands down one of the best most iconic scenes in horror history
what happened to 50 cent	not sure he sort of disappeared
i think the pats in a close game how about you	i think pittsburgh takes it i cant see any nfc team competing with the pats or steelers
yeah i think jarjar binks should haunt george lucas for eternity what a gawdawful stepin fetchit character	and how did you like the way a bunch of those bad guy aliens talked like imperialist chinese leaders how embarrassing
i agree	did you know recently theyve been doing shows in las vegas
oh that mask and the slow pace and the music	i really like all the new clever horror movies though
what is ait about	indianamerican documentary film about the children of prostitutes in sonagachi kolkatas red light district the widely acclaimed film
really i would never have guessed	yeah fairly new formed in 2009
oh thats funny	yeah i think so too
hopefully it is	got a full band
i loved his wife she was not only beautiful but was pretty much what you would want in an ideal wife if you were in his shoes	its amazing how she had so few speaking lines but just her demeanor and the emotions from her eyes in all the pivotal moments just made you feel what she was feeling thats good acting
yup they will be playing out of vegas	vegas  really
its death metal with more melodic guitar riffs and choruses	im not sure i like the sound of that
i know but you know it took jayz to squash the beef	yeah then they made that track reservoir dogs
yea that was just some rediculous fight where nobody could even win	exactly
thank you for being a friend travel down the road and back again	your heart is true youre a pal and a confidant

i took my daughter for lunch today	thats sweet have you seen any movies together lately
will bryce dallas be in this one as well	yes she is slated to reprise her role as claire dearing
about what	just something dumb
which jurassic movie was your favorite	probably the first one i didnt really care about the sequel the third one or the latest jurassic world
like lcd soundsystem sounds a lot like 80s music	really like who
he was their number one receiver	the giants snatched him quickly
what do you mean	everyone has different ideas about whats fashionable
what else	i like the 40 year old virgin and knocked up
i think she is	thats probably why she released cut to the feeling
that is pretty crazy aaron rodgers is pretty dominate	yeah its hard to tell what the problem is anymore everyone blames the coaching but i dont know
who do you think is the better actor in this movie michael fox or chris lloyd	they both did an excellent job in all three movies this one in particular i think fox did a great job
good i had a 100 bet on it	good for you
yeah he might do that for a season and then head back to coaching	in the colleges not the pros
yeah you cant really replicate the old rage against the machine without the lead singer zach de la rocha but i went to see them live and they sound pretty good	maybe if i saw them live i would like them better
everyone loves music	there is definitely something for everybody
what are your favorite music videos	i actually havent watched a music in a while
i think a lot of musicians in the art pop genre are very different and expressive in ways that arent the norm i also like that she plays the piano beautifully and writes her own music	that is so cool i thought she left the music world for awhile
i experience the emotions of that time and space when i hear it	ahh the good old days
but i am also a big fan of the song crazy	i dont particularly like that song to be honest
what did you think	it was very interesting  but i will say that it didnt make me jump off my seat
who does he play	he plays the main character charlie and his dad
morgan freeman has been in so many films	he has and yet i cant think of a lot of movies ive seen with tim robbins
have you heard of alan walker	yes he made his debut through ncs
what do you mean	he writes some incredibly good songs that i love deep down inside but hes really hit and miss
if you like pop and country you must like taylor swift	yeah im a fan i liked her more when she was country though
well who can forget the four seasons	i feel like people who dont know classical music well even know this one
do you know the rapper future	yeah hes one of the best rappers of all time
i completely agree with you even though the songs from frozen are pretty catchy	oh i know i went to kareoke last week with my friends and at least 3 groups sang let it go and by the end of the night it was stuck in my head
i agree  i also think that lady gaga sounds like ella fitzgerald	i think so too  she really had a beautiful voice
they would need jermaine depree to produce them tho for that same ol school rnb sound and i dont think they talk to him anymore	really i didnt hear that i wonder why
so they had to figure out how to rid them so that the lake would become safe enough again to go back into the water at the end they lead the head leader piranha to the boats	and they tricked them into thinking they were going to have some more dinner by eating people and the sheriff and the captain teamed up and blew them away
i cannot wait to see conor oberst this weekend i hope he plays empty hotel by the sea or cape canaveral	good luck with any old stuff according to setlistfm hes mostly doing new stuff mostly salutations and some of the newer bright eyes stuff
i have only seen him in super hero characters do you know any other movies that he is in	of course i do he is one of my favorite actors he´s been in the prestige les miserables real steel kate  leopold the fountain van helsing sword fish peter pan australia just to name a few
youre right he is very young but he could ware down as well with the way that he plays	yea he plays hard and he is fearless thats for sure

which ones	i really like the star wars series
i think tom brady should retire	why do you think that
do you like katy perry	i am not a fan of female vocals
i wish they would do some more	yeah get away from all that cgi stuff
huh	the movie called the room
yes actually a lot of them	tell me a few maybe ill give them a listen
well its not one of his most famous albums it has quite a mellow sound to most of its songs  i especially like chloe which was not a big hit but which remains one of my favorite elton john songs	didnt elton go through a bit of a slump at one point when his popularity took a bit of a dive
bye	bye
oh thats right and he told luke skywalker that he was 900 years old in that movie	we might not see an origins movie about yoda but maybe we will see him in the upcoming sequels
yeah and its as strange as any music of the time	i totally agree  even if they didnt write it all or even play it all doesnt matter
i think its a bit of looking back and nostalgia	i know  like todays music is bad and that one is so pure
well show me how	i will
its the whole is greater than the sum of the parts  a synergistic effect	thats a good way to explain it who else was in it besides amy adams
i know especially with having the rock in it	not to mention efron from the high school musical movies i thought they wold be a bigger draw
any thoughts on the upcoming nfl season	yesits going to be fun
the little girls doll i cried probably	oh yeah i felt so bad for her
that is a pretty good pick actually	i feel like everyone knows that song while billie jean is a great song i think more people know sweet home alabama
yeah also wasnt lin manuelmiranda involved with moana	he was he worked on the music
yeah dan deacon  remember when he had people come up and dance with him	we should have gone down there
yes they changed it a little bit before it was released	that is a cool title
yeah i really like the classic sounds of music like this	me too have you heard the electric violins playing some of these
he was good but you know who the man then was	oh yes lawrence taylor was unreal
who else do they have at qb	christian hackenberg and bryce petty
i like how they took out a tank in that movie	that scene was great lots of action
i loved them in the hoth scenes even though they fell apart	that was one of my favorite scenes out of all of the star wars movies
have you ever listened to any of chris crockers  music	youre talking about the guy that loved britney spears right
me too it would be good to see them go far into the playoffs	i would be buying some game tickets if that happened
the steelers	do you think they will be good this year
hey what do you think about steroids in football	the guys are tested now i do not think it is a problem any more
space shows and movies should definitely be realistic when portraying it	the way she catapulted back when she cut herself loose was terrible
whats his deal	he is crazy but very talented
well why not they use the dark side right	using the dark side doesnt make one a sith the sith were wiped out anyway
i remember there was a company that put your own name on your jeans	so i could become an instant designer
so true i think pocahontas is like that too	how so
which dwarf do you like the most	bashful

was it a cool stadium back then	it was okay riverfront stadium one of those old multipurpose donut shaped stadiums

my daughter loves justin bieber	so does mine
ryan gosling christian bale steve carell and brad pitt were the main characters	nice thats a star studded cast

i saw whitney on tour with natalie prass last week it was one of the better shows ive been to	whitney houston
ok truthfully i think kawhi leonard should be mvp	interesting  i mean i am sure he will get some votes
yea but her whole cd is actually really good	what is it called
i know her debut album was great its all great i dont get it	aquarius yes it was outstanding all hands on deck wildfire bet on it the list goes on
its pretty funny it has ice cube and charlie day	oh charlie day is great  i liked him in pacific rim
there were a lot of effects obviouslyi thought they were really good	when did the original beauty and the beast come out
it seems that way that and his performance	so he isnt winning enough to make his not so distant past go away
i rewatched the usual suspects the other day and the more i think about this movie the more ludicrous it seems	if youre talking about the giant plot hole in the movie as ludicrous then yes i very much agree
do you have any favorite quote or quotes from the star wars movies	my favorite quote was by admiral ackbar
interesting choice  why	hes an interesting character  hes a strong jedi and he is a good mentor
whatd you think about it	its interesting its a new sound for him not what i expected
why do you think so many movies are made in california	thats a good question i guess because the weather is great
yes he was the voice of branch	there was a lot of great music in the movie too
yes i think she was	what a nice bit of trivia i never knew that
yes sometimes there is not always great new music to listen to	yes that is true
yeah that girl from pirates of the caribbean and that guy who plays the monk in pillars of the earth	thats keira knightley and matthew macfadyen i know which film that was
yes that would be worth going to court for	i know comedy at its finest
good pick they sound as good as ever	yeah im just thrilled that theyre back from their hiatus
really thats awesome i didnt get to see that performance	paul looks a little bit older now i noticed  but he can still rock a crowd
yes it was good	there was so much action in it
ive seen lots of comments about his weight and it contributing to injuries	i think i remember hearing that he was overweight
me too	john lennon is an icon
thats right i imagine apple spent a lot of money on that commerical	its funny that marian hill probably benefitted the most from that commerical
also i heard that the let it go song was added after they nearly finished the movie	i do not think that is true but if it is that is cool
oh yeah hes a lot like cutler but with him it feels like overconfidence gets him more	yeah the team whether its the jets or the eagles get rolling and it is fumble or interception time for him
did you see the recent claim by that rolling stone writer that bob dylan invented hip hop	yeah i did what did you think about it
you really didnt know that	honest
wow sounds like id like it a lot	yes as lovecraft adaptations go its a combination of some stuff but excellent horror movie in my opinion
i like the blues	what artists
whos your favorite director	tough choice i think id have to go with wes anderson though
and flanders and bart bonding was wierd	and completely unrealistic
the scene in the elephant grave yard was scary	true but at least it wasnt a long scene
it was i just didnt think it was much like the story	i had heard that as well
so did i	thats cool
is there a lot of action	oh yea and costner saves the day
me too patrick swayze is a hunk	yes he is
well maybe theyll do a good job	i think they will  the previews look good
thats just how good i think andrew luck is	so he will put the team on his back and carry them through the playoffs
what is your favorite movie	my favorite movie of all time
it sure was it was pretty close the whole time	yeah the spurs struggled a little bit in the 2nd and 3rd quarters it looked like cost them the game in the long run
lets talk about music	thats a great topic
yeah i think you are right he is still getting his comedy acting chops	central intelligence was good because he got to focus mostly on being an action star doing stunts and fight scenes
i was thinking of going to the movies do you know of anything that is out at the moment	right now i know that the mummy cars 3 and wonder woman are out
youre not lying darren sproles is a little beast for his age	what do you mean for his age  hes a top 10 running back in the whole league
thats what i was thinking also	they havent done anything noticeable in years
you gotta do something to get fultz into the lineup	but that for a rookie
so whats your favorite	after all these years bad romance is still my favorite
no  but they did  show  him grow  closer  to the  team	do you think there will be a  third one
i remember that that is when i fell in love with that song	it sold over 4 million singles and won 2 grammys
yes i know what you mean i loved the harry potter movies i was sad when they were over there are some good movies coming out soon too	oh i saw there is going to be a new minions movie did you see the new guardians of the galaxy movie
ive read some things	watch out for seattle too
yeah and he was getting old and not as productive	agreed
i think dres the chronic is pretty good but im going to go with straight outta compton	really thats a little bit old at this point
did you see that the new lorde album melodrama is out	no way already i love the song green light
i have great news	what is your news
it was great he a lot energy on stage a had a really great time	i cant wait for him to get released from prison and come out with some more music
supposedly they are going to release two more albums this year	whoa nice i need to check out the last few albums still the last album i bought was things falling apart
what was your favorite song of theirs	i would have to go with crossroads
the sense of humor is excellent	i love kuzco
it would be pretty awesome	well they might do one some day you never know
no hardly any even though they had great actors for the parts they just hardly gave them any lines or airtime	maybe ill wait for it to come out on netflix
that should be interesting	why is that
that reminds me there are some good comedies right now on theaters	which ones we should go see them
what kind of music do you like to listen to on a rainy day	well it depends if i want to be in flow with nature or i want to be energetic
thanks for telling me so much about the sport  i think i definitely need to see the game in live action	certainly  it will surely be a good time
did you want to dress up like her when you were a kid	yeah i even got shoes that looked like her glass slippers
sure you dont i actually do though	i think classic rock has a certain sound
yep that was them they played it during a party in that movie	yea rap was great back then too
me too he was my favorite player	i hated when indiana let him go
they  did  do  you want  to  ride   as a  track  right	and i  really like  the party feel of  that   track
have you seen any star wars movies recently	i saw number three
i wish there would be another punk rock renaissance it would be so great	its unlikely to happen kids today are too complacent and apathetic
yeah the whole movie is full of music my favorite song was how far id go my one year old niece dances during the whole movie	thats awesome yeah im going to watch that tonight with my daughter thanks for telling me about it
they should make a movie with all the same actors like some type of reunion	yes the breakfast club all dressed pretty in pink and blew out sixteen candles together sounds good huh
still got mauer	haha hes washed up
do you know a lot of tim mcgraw songs	yes i do i love tim mcgraw
not me i found that too weird for my taste i like their earliest stuff so sweet melodic and romantic	i dig it but for me when they started to get morei dont know spiritual and psychedelic thats when they got really interesting
i love the scenery and the storyline  princess tiana is so beautiful	oh and prince naveen is so handsome  i love that it was set in new orleans
yeah	well tell me
yeah but he wears a mask	good
me too i really liked prometheus	i did too even though some of the critics were hard
she cant help it if fans hold her to a certain regard	of course she can if she remained humble she wouldnt act the way she does now
i guess this is why you should surround yourself with good people rather than yesmen	george needed someone to hit him over the head in the story concept stage and straighten him out everyone would have benefited
like he has never saw a more beautiful woman in all his life his gaze says i want you for the rest of my life	he sounds so dreamy i bet anastasia falls head over heels for him
comic book movies with superheros are always rushed	not always some are pretty good
im from cleveland so im a browns fan	ouch at least your baseball and basketball teams are doing well
yes  if you watch et you will see yoda and if you watch star wars youll see et	i remember et in star wars  he was in the senate in episodes 13 right
yes it was and he got the maurderers map	he was unstoppable
yes way too out there for me	are you more of the rubber soul type
the new descendants movie is coming out soon	i heard we liked the first one
i agree the scores i like the most are music that really moved me or added an emotional layer to the action on the screen	what other composers do you like
there are so many good actors in hollywood these days	i know do you have a favorite
better than the first	i wouldnt say that
well arent the two weapons functionally similar	yes i guess so with the latter just being bigger
yeah that did turn out to be a good one  i had heard that they may want to do away with kicking all together though	i heard that too and i hope they dont  kicking is an important part of the game
yeah the trailer is sometimes different than the movie	i cant wait to see how it turns out
it is only a trend if others think it looks good or it starts to become popular	yeah it at least as to have something that pops
oh i see yeah i cant see brady playing if hes not 100	me neither but as long as he feels good and is playing well who knows how long he will go
i have seen that i think micheal douglas movie right	no this movie stars ashley judd and morgan freeman
another great song from company is another hundred people its about all the people who move to and live in new york city	oh then i definitely want to hear that one i like the music from a little night music
well  in free agency they got eddie lacy and he is really good	lacy came from green bay right
they do they are the best couple	so cute
yes the shoes too that is one nasty thing to wear	i can only imagine that flies were all over her
exactly how i feel  but i love the action and optimus primes voice	gotta go  see you later
was he better than samuel l jackson	not at all they were both equally awesome
yeah it really was  i love the music he produces	hes triple platinum isnt he
the one with selena gomez	i love that one
he was too stubborn to take advice and learn from mistakes	speaking of mistakes how about elis interceptions
david morse as mike webster was unreal	god that was sad to see
im honestly not sure what to expect	understandableill definitely watch to see what happens
mine is beatles	ah the first album
i will i used to play so its not hard for me to follow	i sometimes lose track of who has the puck
he was also in 10 cloverfield lane as well as the belko experiment	ive watched 10 cloverfield lane and that was so good and suspensful i havent watched the belko experiment yet but i remember you telling me it was a very entertaining watch
i like her songs	so do i
yes it really is	is it a romantic movie
should i see it	its worth watching
thats a huge spectrum i think his part is small enough that it wont affect the outcome of the movie though	when does it come out
whenever i think about her i get this image of a drunk rocker chick sticking her pierced tongue out at me and then puking on my shoes	thats vivid and kind of icky
yeah precisely that one	its a bit different more of a disco vibe than a synth rock vibe but i dig it
i love christina applegate too	shes such an attractive woman
i know i know i was losing my mind too but then they just turned it around	like two different teams like they learned how to play after the half
yeah i seel what you mean	not that is was bad or anything bui want to be like you ooot i jut like my disney to have some singing in it
of course the beat drop in the chorus is amazing	yeah it makes me want to dance
do you like shawn mendes	i have never heard of him who is that
sure it has that first release 24k magic and now that other song is out thats what i like	are those your favorite on the album
was it scary	no it was just weird
i want to go somewhere tonight	why
they do arenas	i wonder who goes
yeah actually he did discover sidious back on naboo and had been lurking in the shadows ever since his original plan was to corule from the shadows with palpatine as chancellor	i guess we know how that turned out
i know i remember the parties	black and yellow one of my favorite songs
im going to go see that new m night shyamalan movie tonight	the one about the kids visiting their grand parents ive seen that one
you deathly have to have thick skin to playing at philadelphia	well it hasnt worked out in decades
apparently the writer heard that her friends son had a similar story	truth is stranger than fiction
it was suppose to be tove lo but since the concert was delayed a few months it was a couple of nobodys	thats too bad tove lo would of made for a better show
undeniably i think he should have just been upfront	ya just give credit where credit is due
great  let me know how it goes and what you think	i will
sadly it been that way for the last several years	i have no idea what sean payton is thinking as if he doesnt coach the team better this year hell be fired
yeah you can tell hes been practicing	im sure they all have
they started back in 1992 i use to listen to them all the time	me too they were actually just called blink at first but some irish band wanted to take them to court so they added the numbers
yeah except more targeted towards the younger audience	i vaguely remember it i remember the artists performing more than anything
yeah he is fantastic he wrote a bunch of hits recently and the ladies love his music why dont you like hiphop	hip hop makes my head hurt from all of the loud bass that comes out of the speakers
im more of a james taylor fan	i love his laid back style  do you listen to john denver
how so	well how about the fact that all the women in the kingdom got all dolled up for the prince
same here  hopefully we can go	yea it will be a great time
ok we will definitey add those to the playlist	this will be a great cd i cant wait to listen to it
darth vader was always trying to make luke skywalker join the dark side but he did not	i know but in the end darth vader became a decent person and left the dark side
dont you think theyre a bit overrated though	not at all their music crosses so many genres
very true	anyways nice talking to you
and he had a german sweetheart too  its sad that they got rid of her in the next movie	well they were always losing people throughout those films
one of my favorite passtimes is watching movies do you like to watch movies	yeah i like watching movies too whats your favorite movie
i really think youd like it	i dont think so im not really a fan of lady gaga
yes did you know he used to work on breaking bad	no way really
exactly as they have the lunch pale type attitudeblue collar america represents	regardless lets go falcons super bowl or bust
i wonder if we will see a popular band like that again in our lifetimes	im not sure it seems like people dont have the patience for bands and albums anymore
hopefully people remember it in 10 years	i am sure they will
cleveland of course yet again	i agree lebron is at his prime
true and the singing in cosi is beautiful its pure mozart with all the swells and sweet harmony	but wheres the drama and the angst that pulls at your heart like a good puccini
did you ever see the usual suspects	yes amazing cast
cant think of the name but with angelina jolie she is a workaholic and it is kind of a breakout moment for her	i think i recall this she is a broadcaster in the film it was a good scene
not true he  has abilities past that	i think lamar is good for 3 more albums
me too i really like when george harrison played the sitar	he really respected ravi shankar and benefitted from his influence
yes they do they got a new quarterback	thats what i heard have you seen him
so you think pages guitar playing was better because the band he was in was better	wellyeah  the songs were much better and in the end thats what its all about
yup	we listened to that all the time in the car and we drove a lot
i am sure you will enjoy it	ok thank you for telling me
why a guilty pleasure	because the majority of the people a hang around with hate those albums
yeah those are great  ive been getting into a lot of kirby krackle and no more kings recently	kirby krackle  like the comics graphics
its a band	do they have any popular songs
they did but theyre back together again	no way we should see them
i love watching cam newton	yeah hes exciting
i wonder what tupac and biggie would be doing today if they  were alive	i liked california love
oh you catch that one how cool i wanted to watch it didnt had the time	well it was a great movie with a lot of action
thats the best place to sit	yeah only the die hard fans are there
yea thats what i heard	i am so excited to see deadpool now
do you like listening to lady gaga	yes  i think she is so talented  i would love to see her in concert
wake up with not pajamas	lets jump in the cadillac
aww shortstop has he tried second base	yes but he prefers short stop
she was quite a match against mike meyers	she sure was i cant think of a better character for him to go up against
ok what is curve ball slider	slider definitely i got it to a point where it spirals
its the guys name but he has a band he spells it catapillar	no never heard of him any good
sounds good	great ill look up the times and text you
why	because they are just trying to capitalize on something that doesnt need to be changed
yeah thats true  the therapist should have seen it coming but she was blind	i dont understand though how anyone could be kidnapped in broad daylight
im a check him out on my free time you ever heard of nino man	yeah i heard him on hot 97 with funk master flex
and shes only 14	wow i wish i could sing like that when i was 14 or now
youre plenty wrong you were wrong with the nicks	i was absurdly right with the nicks
interesting what do you think your favorite song of hers is	probably poker face what about you
you should listen to their song  cocaine gonna kill my hunny dead	that doesnt sound very upbeat at least in topic
i loved all the movies in the matrix series but i think the first one was the best	keanu reeves was cast perfectly for that role
why do you say that	their pitching is terrible
thats true	whos your favorite character
good good give them a shot theyre on tour right now	really have you seen them
that was a great movie	it opened up my eyes to all sorts of new music
did you see alex smith throw all of those passes	yes i believe he threw for 363 yards
thatd be a disaster for the cfl	not really theyd get paid a lot probably that should help
great thats just what length im looking for	glad i could be of assistance
i still think one of the top all time thriller movies was psycho	i have to agree with you
i do not remember the ending much	well then you need to watch it again
here we go steelers  here we go	lol  they got mowed down by new england
as much music that he gave us that makes all of june celebratemichaeljackson month	i know thats right
well one of the members left for a solo career so theres only four in the band now	and they didnt want to change it to four harmonies
what type of music is your favorite	i like all music but rap music and hip hop are the best
are you ready for the season	you mean the nfl season
i wonder if they will ever make a sequel to that	i do not think so as they have never caught the bad guy
i think they should matthew stafford is a great quarterback	he just needs help from the offensive line and they did upgrade that in the off season
have you seen trolls	yes
do you know any new characters that will be in the new descendants movie	i heard ursulas daughter is in it
so what was your favorite part in the movie	i liked the final part when darth vader appeared
well i didnt know he was bringing three of his little nephews with us so it wasnt the romantic outing i had hoped for	but you enjoyed the movie yes
it sounds more like an action movie	adam makes it funny hes basically the same as he would be in real life but with cool spy moves
it worked for a little while with teams being caught off guard	but then coaches started to learn how to counter it
some of those subgenres even ended up becoming big too	im guessing you mean heavy metal
yeah totally im surprised there wasnt more buzz about it it was really well done	did you see scoop
the only release that doesnt have the pan and scan and is in hd is the dvhs release	and let me guess dvhs players arent too common
yummy yummy yummy indian giver and dizzy	i havent heard of any of those songs
the live game experience is just not what it used to be	i will travel to see an out of town game now before a home game the fans were betrayed here
have you listened to the new band called the goats yet	no  i have not
well i think its part of why these movies work so well	right although the stories in both movies are pretty solid as well
that was has a good plot too i love the super soldier aspect	yes i enjoy it
oh michael keaton	obviously
does it seem to you that lucas seems more distant now in the production of star wars movies	not really hes there  hes not going to let anything happen to his crown jewel
so i have a movie question for you and it is kind of hard	oh go ahead it cant be that hard
not like the bills or jets  they are welcome mats  terrible and could never be called  a rivalry	i agree i think for it to be a rivalry in the nfl  the teams must be on par  performance wise
i think its his last funny movie to be honest	what did he make after that
is rod stewart still touring	i think he just finished up one
who is the best pop group of all time	no question it is duran duran you
its called paranormal	thats a good name for the kind of music he does
well yeah i remember that	so that should indicate that they were creating all kinds of things and that they were trying to narrow it all down to one perfect creation
like when morpheus was training neo in the dojo	exactly that was awesome
very true actually	anyways great talking to you
what do you know about 90s rap	i think it was a lot better than the rap from 2017
it is more mellow than the rap i usually listen to	well it is not the same as west coast rap
which nfl team do you think has the best mascot	whatever the colts mascot is called seems to be pretty entertaining to watch
now that he definitely had	he has lots of personality if nothing else
what is your favorite star wars movie	i would have to say the empire strikes back
i understand but musicicans are different	we are all human beings
what are you talking about there are tons of good action movies	there are tons of action movies but few have really god character development or interesting plot
yes  good memory	but where was yoda in et
yeah i remember first seeing it and knowing i wanted to see more from fincher	so why do you think its so universally despised
or better yet lets go to the movies and watch it	sounds good im free tonight around 8 see you then
it wasnt are you sure	yeah didnt you see it
yes and just like many rappers his earliest stuff is his best	oh wow that is good to know
really you cant think of anything more recent	i know its from the late 90s but its a classic
do you know whos starting at quarterback for the browns this season	well the browns signed brock osweiler who im not thrilled about but i do like their draft pick of deshone kizer and hoping he really shows out well during training camp going into the season
hi there	hey
i actually thought the premise was genius and the way killer killed his victims was outstanding	your sick but to give us all that action planning and murders then the movie turns around and gives us a predictable ending
anyhow i just bought the dvd if youd like to see it again	please
yeah thats my favorite seen i remember seeing that movie in theaters in 2003	me too i have so many memories surrounding that movie
i heard about that ill have to come over for the opener	san francisco i think
do you know what year that album came out	i came out in 1960
all because of kristen stewart	not totally  shes a big part of it but i didnt like the movie
i loved him in those movies  he was my favorite	liam was pretty good as quigon gin too
are you a fan of the beatles	the beatles you mean the supergroup from the 60s
that time concept was really cool	yes it was a different perspective on life
i heard they were so it should be really good	i hope so some of the other movies these guys did were not so great
its definitely different his wife is in it too	i didnt know he was married ill get it next time around
it still looked bad at 2812	then the fumble
that is a little different but yeah old shows get turned into movies all the time too	maybe originality is dead in hollywood everything is just remakes and sequels now
the last movie was a bit of a drag	yeah felt like a been there done that type of thing
yeah lion king is great i also liked tarzan	i have never seen tarzan how is it
which one	the original there is no other one in my book
i like the classics like hannah and her sisters and manhattan	those are great but my favorite was actually radio days
old school beats new school any day	i agree
its singersongwriter stuff with a lot of angst	wait did she do that song ironic
cardinals they train in flagstaff	it will be nice to get out of the heat and watch them practice
you should dedicate an hour and a half and listen to it completely	you know i kind of lost my pasion for them since john frusciante left
i really like his duet with celine now there is a woman who can hit a note	that is a fact i can live without ever hearing my heart will go on again but man can she belt out a song
i think so i seem to remember if being a little more upbeat and some words being sung	yes i want to say right before the fade out to the credits i remember the words celebrate the law
i saw a great movie yesterday	what was it
it is there is alot of cool actors also	who are they
can you tell me more about it	it is very fast and uses drums and bass alot
i like the first one	from the old films
the flaming lips	ive heard of them theyre great
how about anderson paak huh is he talented or what	god i love him he has a voice like no other
that can be boring though i like when you have a team that you know is just dominant	as long as it isnt the pats im good  i dont mind when a team from a certain division wins the division several years in a row
yeah with the digital age weve gone through a lot of weird music	i bet theres a lot of parallels with art rapid onset of musical genres jazz to hip hop to rb to rap to elecronic to trap
oh okay well it was a great game because the cubs won	oh nice what was the final score
what do you like about the first one	i dont know its a solid selfcontained story that doesnt take itself too seriously
is it michael keaton val kilmer adam west george clooney or chrisitan bale	i would have to go with chrisitan bale
i think rihanna has great music	i dont like the way she sings
and it will be a welcomed relief from trolls	i wonder when it comes out
thats hilarious my favorite is the scene where the genie and the rug are playing chess	have you seen the emporers new groove
how was it	it was really nice it was affordable and showed very many different films
no i cant name any actually	so he was a one hit wonder
true but im still going	oh yeah same lets go together
i used to refer to garth brooks as barf brooks in his hay day	ha ha thats a cheap shot
tonight	lets do it
me too  might be my favorite pixar disney movie  i love the story and the animation	sometimes i feel like retired mr incredible
i hate green bay	the cheese sure is good though
yeah but its bad because they are obsessed	how do you mean
do you wanna know	i am not sure
he is on the decline	and
on a website	did you order a pair
oh okay now i can see that makes sense	i liked the pretty car who was mators girlfriend
owl city i dont think ive heard of him	his real name is adam young
whats your favorite ballad	i really liked his singing on yesterday
i am a green day fan	they are good to
that is funny  i am kind of the same way	oh which ones are your favorites
i kind of agree	marvel is really stomping them
some stuff like august burns red and between the buried and me	sounds good not to heavy and friendly to people
yes it was quite funny	i would expect that out of borat
wth dont you cone over to my place alone to give it a shot	sure what other plans do you have
do you know the rap artist yae yae jordan	i think i have heard of him
haha that chicken was brilliant	i like that they made her body look different than all of the other disney princesses too
what brought you to liking this music	when i prounce around i like to listen to past time classic oldies why not the beatles
well it was it just shows the story about maleficent and how she feel in love with princess aurora	who played princess aurora
do you like one direction	yes harry styles is so cute
gizmo was good  its not like he wanted anything bad to happen	its funny how much different he was than the other gremlins
and of course theres the famous you talking to me scene one of my favorites	agreed its one of the most iconic scenes in cinema
agree played that song way too much on the radio	in some ways i really liked their x  y album
nice whos your favorite band	id definitely have to go with black flag on that one
great movie it made me cry	i think all disney movies made me cry at some point
disney movies are still my favorites	mine too  i watched them as a child began purchasing dvds for my daughter and now my granddaughter is watching them
sounds like it i miss the days of kobe and shaq though	those were epic times in basketball
that is too funny i can just imagine you jamming around to that song in your room on full blast	if you think that is funny you should have seen my hair styles that i had during that time
i guess now nobody would	luke wilson is a pretty good actor
yep  lets blame him  he doesnt play for the steelers now	huey richardson is the one i remember as being a horrible pick
i wouldnt mind going again if you want to go	that would be great
how did they get so big in america	probably from radio play on popular stations
yes i love her voice its just the lyrics that dont do it for me	maybe shes appealing to todays generation
was it a great catch	well admittedly it was just a little better than routine but in context it was the catch
i watched a really funny older movie the other day	what movie was that
hah who do you have coming out of the afc	brady just keeps going and going like the energizer bunny
i mean the 70s do you ever listen to that stuff	i listen to some of it there were so many good classic bands that got big during that decade
then she could have went fisttofist against ares and beat him into submission	now that sounds cool too bad they didnt go that route it was still a good flick though
sounds like a good plan to me i could watch it again	great i look forward to seeing the movie
that show was so funny	he was the funniest character on disney channel back then
thats awesome is it scary	i wouldnt say outright horrifying it is creepy though
yes it was called before i go to sleep	i have been wanting to see that one
modest mouses rock the boat is a great indie rock tune	are they really indie rock
and then go back to being the eagles and crush all hope for the remainder of the season	exactly august just needs to get here
we sure can i am really excited about marcus mariota	i do not blame you he is a really good young player
like its basketball	work is work idiot
i like when he is late to  transfiguration and sees mcgonagall turn from a cat	yeah in the first movie him and harry are pretty mean to hermione
goldie hawn	goldie hawn that was goldie
shes written for so many famous artists  and she started writing those hits since she was 14	wow thats so young  can you give me examples of songs i might know
im very impressed by timber thomas	the nfl player
whatre your top movies	its complicated i loved moneyball as a baseball fan but theres one surprising movie that would be my favorite if they had the right ending
i know what you mean  most people dont want to spend 3 hours watching a football game	i was watching a game last year and realized that it was like 3 or 4 plays and then a series of commercials
so people like patsy cline and waylon jennings	exactly as for newer artists i just think sam hunt incorporating rap into country is awful
ill have to check it out what did you think	i thought it was pretty good it sounds more like original weezer
how long has it been	i dont knowa few years

totally lots of movies based on true stories do that too so its super possible	yeah ill watch it anyway though
do you have any good oldies i can listen to	yes listen to the beach boys
their personalities alone deserve it but anyway the other problem is that mlb doesnt do enough to dissuade the fights	the fans cheer it heavily too

they are very talented though	i will give them that
funny thing is no not really but i do like to know the lines seems like the overunder regularly comes down to the final few plays of the game	i know right bookies are smart
you mean the guy who played for the rams wasnt he known as a dirty player	he was a tough player of course the guys on the losing end of his rough play are going to call it dirty
i agree	that guy had one of the best sinkers ever
hm see its animated but it might be a little scary for kids to see	are there any famous voices in it

oh ive heard of them but i dont really know much about them	let me guess you know the song creep
well joplin kinda went crazy he started jumping all over the place	how so
its still a great kids movie to this day	i agree but most kids today want to watch whats new instead of whats good
how	do a little rockabilly for example its so great to dance to  stray cat strut or queens crazy little thing called love

im just happy hes still making music after all these years so many stop or take long breaks but he really hasnt	hes had a break or two here and there but it wasnt for long stretches and he always comes back
gary oldman	who plays caesars wife cornelia

yes is that the song from the trolls sound track	yes it is my daughter loves that song

he is one of my favorite actors	i guess i will go see that movie  the name sounds dumb though
unless the creators were already aware of the statue and maybe got inspiration for it prior to hunchbacks release	that could be the cathedral was standing long before lion king

so	it is going good
what if hockey players were allowed to use jiu jitsu	i dont even think it would be hockey at that point

oh did the lady hypnotize him	yep she did
sure you got time	yes i do im not doing anything
i know what you mean	i guess thats why there are so many ads and parking is expensive
come to think of it wasnt quiet riot like one of these first hair metal bands of the 80s	yeah them and twisted sister  you could really argue those two pretty much started the whole hair metal band trend
fairly often you know kids these days love tv and movies	i take my kids only once a month we tend to see family comedies more than animated movies
no im serious	isnt she so young though
what is your favorite song of his	i would have to say slowly or four ton mantis
mark jones	is there more than one film
the last scream totally holds up to the trilogy	firstly randy would disagree with you on that one and character veto is final veto

really	yeah it is a good thought
i dont remember it was so boring i think i felt asleep on my couch	you think you felt asleep
yep i grew up in oakland and i have been to a few games	that is awesome who are their best players
yes but it hard to concentrate with all the noise in the back ground and i can hardly make out what they are sayingi know sometime i have to concentrate on the lyrics to under stand them	not always but sometimes
no i wasnt alive back then but its documented that he did	i still think babe ruth is over rated baseball has changed so much since he played

i concur	it was nice talking to you
im very excited as well did you hear	hear about what
is warner still playing	no
oh wow i didnt know that	yes it got great reviews too but didnt do as big as it should at the box office
they are a great team	i think they will make it to the superbowl
they all played well	they did but lebron had an off night
i wonder if i were in that position if i would decide in faver of my career or in faver of my health	it would be a tough choice but its no wonder so many of the nfl players have violent episodes when their not playing
yes	who is your favorite
who was in that movie	hugh jackman it was a wolverine film
well the movie has mary elizabeth winstead basically locked in down in a bomb shelter in john goodmans basement	wow i didnt realize john goodman was the bad guy hes such a good actor i can see him playing this role well
good talking to you	you too
what did you think of 90s disney movies	i really liked the little mermaid
ha ha  cole swindes aint worth the whiskey is another good one to do that with	i think i know that one next time i will add that to my list
id have to say mine is superman i mean who can beat him	youre right about that but i feel that he can be a little selfish sometimes
they should lower the volume	i doubt that would go over well with the fans
and flynn rider easily the best disney prince	definitely the cutest disney prince
whats your second favorite song	my second favorite would probably be love shoulda brought you home
like really	yes though i love one of his classic cry me a river
i just hated dark shadows though or most tim burton movies lately	sleepy hollow is also one of tim burtons better movies
yeah that was a pretty rough pill for them to swallow i would imagine	han solo is my favorite character he cracks me up
who was the worst team last year browns	yes they picked a defensive end myles garrett
oh no doubt about that i think itll be strange seeing him in a raiders jersey next year	im excited about that the raiders are on a climb and i think theyll really challenge the patriots this year and might even make it to the superbowl
plant went on to sing in the honedrippers but that didnt last	i know but page is still the greatest guitarist ever
can you not pick one	i could if i thought about it
do you know of john coltrane	yes im familiar with him
what is it about	its set in the 50s and whoppi becomes a housekeeper for a man and his daughter
journey is a great example of that	yeah steve perrys voice is very distinct
the acting in them is so generic	i watched one the other day with eric roberts
the san francisco 49ers moved to santa clara the bay area is losing its second team	so true what a shame it is i think the broncos and patriots will make it to next years super bowl
i liked her song wrecking ball	that was a good one very pop and bubble gum type of feel you know
he has powers over the air and he was given a fishhook by the gods and it helps him turn into different animals	sounds kinda funny
what era is your favorite	i like the silent era and the french new wave
do you have any favorite songs or albums in particular	yeah i really like everything on ds2 by future
as far as sports movies i love miracle the best	it was based on a true story
well sometimes it moves to fast it misses things	well that can be bad
i liked that one a lot too pretty incredible storyline and think ti is based on a real guy	hard to believethe acting was really great in it too patel has been on my radar since the movie slumdog millionaire
something like that but not quite	well then what is it
youre funny hes washed up now	i know well we might see him on a geico commercial now
superman could have 1 shotted batman	i agree
i have been and wow some are just amazing	i have liked some songs from movies
that is fairly impressive	exactly and they secured most of their core players from last season for this upcoming season
heck yes me too ari would make a perfect duo with katy	theyre both the queens of pop at the moment
who sings this song	the singer of this particular song is dua lipa
it was really scary	and creepily
you get just that right catchy jingle and you are golden	my husband and our then roommate used to love to drive me crazy by singing tender crisp bacon cheddar song from the burger king commercial i hate that music
you mean that scene on the mining planet	yeah that ambush wouldnt have looked out of place in a world war ii movie
it is difficult to do accuratly when you are moving through a peice and need to move on to the next notes	doesnt the neck of your guitar have those lines to help you
i specifically got friday tickets because blink 182 is playing that day	i love blink 182 they have so many great sing along songs
i think its called the last jedi	thats right i wonder if that person is rey
great idea that is such a heartfelt song	i agree it has a lot of meaning behind it
what are you playing	you dont wanna know that man
eitheror was sadder and more sparse	i liked the sparcity
oh i forgot that one i like the newest ones	those are ok but they kind of go on too long
fine movies comedy anything else mister picky	ok then no we have a question comedy movies definitely jim carey
yes i love that scarlett overkill was such a badass girl villian sandra bullock was so good in the part	my kids love that young gru is in the minion movie  he can be seen at villian con and then at the end of the movie
i love that i might have to get that i typically listen to cds	cds are great too any way you can is helpful listening to music in the car is the best
how so	i had to delete that crap off my computer
me too they are a great rock band	are there any better
the first one was funny but the second one was just silly	did you see that the first part of the end credits shows clips from this movie and the original
everyday im hustling	i know that song had no idea rick ross did it though
oh so its a remake of the old story	something like that
i am loving that song despascito with justin beiber	me too  it is so catchy
im not really sold on eli manning as the giants quarterback going forward hes so inconsistent in his performances for me	thats been elis game though you can criticize it but at the end of the day hes still a two time superbowl champion and seems to be tom bradys kryptonite
in which year he was picked in draft	1969
they were so bad last year	dont forget the year before
i forgot he was on that team	lastly he retired from the vikings
yeah they have to keeps a clean pocket for him to be effective especially on downfield throws	if the line can keep the pocket clean for five seconds ryan will find someone open they have so many good pass catching options
what are some of your favorite movies	i like enter the dragon and fist of legend
now we started this because we wanted to understand how to construct an atonal music piece	yes there are 16 i took the 4 and mutliplied it it looks good to me
definitely the cavalliers just beat the celtics by like 40	yeah that was crazy
what kind of music are you interested in	i like all kinds of stuff
yea and the next one looks like it will be even better	thats true the next could be pretty good
of course man star wars music is my jam	so what other types of music do you like
what they make them eat them	no i mean the band  the literally play rhcp songs over and over to drink them nuts
yeah from the fame album	yeah she uses her voice and does so many different things with it
i would have told samuel l naw dude imma stay home and chill tonight	he tried to samuel l come talking that sit in the trunk with the gauge nonsense
i bet it was expensive	i cant remember probably we took the overnight train and wandered around the city until it was time for the concert
you know  thaaaat songgoes da da da da	hahah  yeah i think i know which one you mean  it is catchy
wasnt it snow white	no it was sleeping beauty
haha yeah honestly every time i go out i hear that song being played at least 56 times	by far the greatest song juvenile ever put out it just flows perfect for playing in a club the girls go wild when they hear it
yea sort of	but what about all the noise
it is because it is not radio friendly	what do you mean
i can imagine that that is hysterical	the top thing on my bucket list is going to see them live
some of the guys may want to leave for bigger deals	and then they shuffle in the next round
great performer	exactly
im surprised  what dont you like about them	i just think they are rather absurd  hard for me to suspend disbelief
i cant remember the last time i actually sat down to watch a movie	you mean at home
circus is my favorite britney spears album	i really like that one
yep there were computers involved by then but most was by hand	wow that makes the movies even cooler
yep james earl jones will be back as mufasa for it	wow no kidding who else is in it
and the beat was so spare but worked so well	i know imagine trying to come up with a rap to put over that though that takes a ton of talent
are there any silent films from disney	fantasia does not have talking
whats your favorite pixar movie	the incredibles you
it wont make a difference because lebron has owned him in the playoffs	yes but he was on a different team and a different system the warriors are too efficient with too many weapons right now
yeah i think psy got a billion views on youtube for that some outrageously high number	do you have a favortie kpop group
yes	i might get it soon
yes bright colors sparkles the more bling the better this summer	i remember tom cruise in top gun with those wayfarers which will definitely be a beach accessory

why do you think that	some of her songs bring up issues people would rather not talk about

did you hear that indiana university finally fired there head coach	yeah i think he was there for about 6 or 7 seasons

what beatles album do you like best	i like sergent peppers lonely hearts club band
rock music can do that it can bring up so many memories	ive actually seen them in concert a few times and they were fantastic

its kind of like a camp but only for a couple hours a day for about a week	is it in a church
theyve got an absurd line up	yeah but theyre not the best
youre such a smart aleck	cant help it
and i swear i heard were revolutionary on george harrisons song julia	thats a new one on me the song was for his mother i think
it borrows a lot from westerns and stuff like the last of us	oh so its not just a big action flick
me too it shows that not all kids have a perfect childhood	also shows the coping skills they can acquire i think this is the only disney movie that shows how the parents die
hahahahaha that crazy man	then explain to me how he is able to produce this long
did you see it in the theater	no i that was before my time
yeah i did but i have to say i was kind of disappointed they made it seem like it was going to be so funny and it fell short for me	i guess i agree i just loved the cast so i would probably watch it again
it also promotes a positive image on the nfl	other sports should learn from the nfl
either one they both are so fun to rock out to	they really are i also love to get into some heart
yeah many of george clintons band members were also were a part of james brown and the jbs	i didnt know that
do you remember what was the release date	according to my remember the release date was april 4 2014
oh yeah  whos that	lynnon after john lennon
im not sure about that but i know that dancing does	wow music is a lot more important than i realize
thats a great choice  mulan was also my favorite movie overall	likewise  it was empowering to women and also the first disney movie with such a big asian cast
okay thank you for the recommendations i have lots of new music to listen to	youre welcome let me know if you want to talk more about music later
small market problems	yeah small problems and a college football state
yeah that lady at the end with the axe looked just like her	yeah but besides from that song i really dont know much about her but i looked online it looked liked she has a strong fan base already
i love coldplay what is the name of the lead singer i forgot his name	his name is chris martin
thats why i loved it so much	true american classic
are there any other tips you would give someone who is just starting out with the guitar	make sure you learn the basics correctly  so you dont develop bad habits

i saw it in the theater with my parents i guess i was about 13	it starred julie andrews

no i just think that it was very fun to watch	any other movies you think i should watch
this is true and with ferrell i bet this one has even more physical comedy	i wonder if they considered steve martin he has always been grerat with physical comedy

whats it about	naming objects outside the window eating yummy snacks and finally falling asleep

which teams	the chicago cardinals now arizona cardinals and decatur staleys chicago bears
i just dont find alot of their stuff that good	you might be the only one to say that
are you going to see the new pirates of the caribbean movie	i will probably see it when it comes out on dvd ive seen all the previous ones
now you tripping the remix of that was the bomb pumps and the bumps pumps and the bumps give me the girl with the pumps and the bumps	man you crazy how about all those parody songs that weird al used to make that dude was crazy

did you see the star wars movie the empire strikes back	yes thats one of the few i did see
yes he does a good job as an agent	i also like tommy lee jones

and van halen	learned everything he knows from clapton ha
it is the definition of a fun song	i like fun songs
yeah pretty good but	i miss waka
that was such a fun song i hope her new album still has some of that pop sensibility to it	yeah i hope so too
whoa brady is 40 already	hes 39 but the superbowl will be next year so he will be 40 but if it doesnt happen this season were talking about brady being 41 and older
the patriots have never been terrible	is this a joke  prior to tom brady the patriots were awful for virtually all of their entire existence
oh yes you know who else you might like courtney barnett	who is that
really how many championships have they won	only 5 they won all their in the early 80s and 90s

i do also i crank the volume when i hear it	he has a great voice
that makes sense such a good song to celebrate a son	yes it is so touching i especially like the lyric the monsters gone hes on the run and your daddys here
yeah but he came back from the acl so strong a few years ago ill bet he has a lot left in the tank	i dont know man watching him play the last two years he looks so much slower
yeah but their game on may 11 they beat the angels 71	detroits pitcher  fulmer is top notch  hes partially why the angels lost i think
me too  it seems like a way to get people angry and riled up	and then they go and do bad things
you are crazy did you see them last year	i think theyre going to be starting brian hoyer this year as qb and theyll be fantastic
the anticipation for the empire strike back was huge  who was your favorite character	i liked han solo  he was the outside of the lines guy  who did you like
ouch im sorry to hear that	hah its ok im a loyal fan
magic stick was a popular one back in 2003	i remember that one i think i know that ive seen the music video
well i wouldnt say its gratuitously crude but yes  its pretty typical of the comedy you can expect from a guy like tj miller	got it  so i should be prepared for lots of swearing and offcolor humor
yes of course	there were over 8200 candles used as set decorations during production
i remember super bowl 3 when joe namath assured a win when he was the underdog	and then they beat the favored colts  soon after the nfl and afl merged

it really is nice for that	i might try that some time
is gene wilder in it too	yes
well i dont see how its not going to be on everyones mind when they watch any of them from now on	i think the character dom is strong enough and the fan base big enough they will be fine
ive heard katy perry is making a come back too	who what does she sing

i need more sebastian the crab in my life	theres a slight homage to sebastian in moana if you caught it the end credits
leprechaun	who directed that
this isnt the most original answer but mastodons new album is pretty good	oh yeah i thought they were kind of past their prime now
and the same actor	no way
i guess that makes sense considering how long its been	yeah some parts still hold up well
i know that was the best part of the movie	i also like when mary and conor finally meet eachother in person
there will be a lot of people there people will be rooting for da bears it will be fun just think of all the tasty nachos and hotdogs	i got my kids and i work
he has been playing huge arenas on his own too	really did he play in los angeles
oh i agree his best performance yet	i will always adore him as jordan catalano frommy so called life
thats true	liam neeson is a fantastic actor though
do you know anyone who has been there	yes every year my cousins pool their money and buy season tickets and rotate who gets them for each game
its about a bunch of allied forces in germany that try to take control of a bridge and hold it against german attackers	that actually sounds pretty intense

yes thats the one did you like it	yes it was really good
i watched it again recently in remembrance of robin williams	oh yeah he played genie didnt he
not really they said it was amicable	yeah when was this
i know  i actually heard one he wrote that was about his baby daughter  it was really sweet	oh really  that seems out of place compared to his other music
its too bad that peter steele died so young he was truly a brilliant musician	he wouldnt have said so he would have said dont mistake lack of talent for genius
i think ive heard of it who is in that	gene hackman stars and roy scheider costars
yea a boring story cant be fixed	and crappy actors make you lose interest
isnt that what creating music is about	you know i dont really know
i like her reporting	she knows what shes talking about
alright i get it	and the mindset of an offensive lineman is quite different than a defensive lineman
yes she does every time i saw her i thought about that movie she was in a long time ago clueless	i loved that movie
she has a lot in this movie and shes good at the part	so is she still with dom
thats true	many top players not only are strong but highly academic
do you like pop music	not really
quite a bit actually	like what
that one is good they did not play it last night though	bummer maybe they will next year

hey did you hear that new song by rihanna	you mean the one called wild thoughts
not a bad choice but what makes return of the jedi number one in your eyes	i think jedi was just a great way to close the saga we got to see the return of anakin and the acting was completely on par
whys that	because there aint no quarterback  a bunch off season trades puts them in even worse position than last year
i believe so	i seem to recall that
is paul walker the main guy in the fast and the furious	yes and vin diesel is the other main guy
why that movie over all the others	well it was my first disney movie
seriously that is kind of messed up	they should have kept them together
i also read that they way rileys mind works scientifically accurate	wow thats pretty neat
tickets are sold out for the first three bands but the rest still have tickets available ranging from 3949596989169 its a big indoor theatre with three levels	ive sat in cheap seats before in the higher sections you can still hear the music and i just took binoculars and then i could see the stage just fine

what happened in that one	it takes place after at worlds end they go on a trip to the fountain of youth
i dont blame the other gungams for kicking him out	me either he probably would have flipped the switch that flooded the whole city thinking he was turning the lights on
i like how the song has a sax solo towards the end	did kenny g really perform that
yea im pretty happy about it	nice talking to you
but what about the patriots and tom brady do you like them as well	no i dont like them at all
i love the classic gibson	led zipplin used gibsons
unfortunately movie studios took that to mean that every movie should be dark and gritty	yeah they misunderstood that batman worked as dark and gritty because batman himself is dark and gritty not because all movies need to be
did you consider going to circle the new tom hanks movie	actually i did but then the reviews werent that good
peter pan was such a good play and movie	i know i really enjoyed it i liked the fairies
it was rereleased in 2013	it became a 3d version
what do you mean by that	every song is good and there is no filler whatsoever  the album is cohesive and an amazing piece of work
hey can you smell that its in the air fall is almost here and football is in the aircan you feel it	oh yeah i can feel it the nfl train is near all day sunday sunday night monday night and dont forget thursdays
however between the two i want the texans to win the superbowl	im with you the texans deserve a chance to win
he was feeling sick they had to finish the take he tried ot rush through wasnt concentration and as a result hit his head	wow amazing how many things you can learn abotu the star wars franchise
me too i think the message is adorable	yeah the whole theme of the movie is cute from what ive seen
again thats all horror though what i like is more traditional new wave stuff	shiny toy guns sort of has that sound in some of their songs
he is way too injury prone for me	how about jimmy graham
shes that young girl that played the ukelele and won americas got talent last year	oh i remember her she is a great musician
i hated the singing too	the acting was ok emma was a good belle
you know the princess merida was played by kelly macdonald	cool i didnt know that

the shaggy dog grooming van is awesome	i would drive it
so sad that the pistons didnt make the playoffs last season	yeah really  they used to be such a good team  i mean they are supposed to still be a good team
what is your favorite johnny mathis song let me guess white christmas	not exactly my favorite is a tie between its not for me to say and chances are
yes please do	what is it rated
but youre not old enough you saw them come out in the theaters originally are you	nope but i think these tapes might even have been taped off of television
theyre a kind of altrock band theyre not super loud or intrusive or anything	then whats the problem
can you name me your top three favorite bands	wow that is going to be really hard for me
right every shoot out lasts for a really long time and every moment is heart pounding action	i cant imagine how creative you would have to be to come up with those scenes
thats a good idea	do you have a hard time falling asleep
rachel weisz plays in it and she is a villain in this thriller	who directs it
yeah lowry seems to fall apart in the big moments i dont trust this team	neither do i they just seem to shrink against the big teams
no he runs away she goes into a mental ward and the crimes are unsolved	bummer
definitely so  id say they were definitely as big a hit in the 1970s as any band could be	they were certainly influential in music
who are your favorite singers for it	i am not familiar with the revealing newmodern ones  but i like blake shelton
everybody i see is doing that crazy move	thats how we dab on them
incredible how talented he is	hes a great banjo player too
i completely agree  what was your favorite album	hands down sgt peppers lonely hearts club band  what about you
24 carat magic it has a great beat	that is actually one of his recent songs but the new release is versace on the floor
did you know eminem is almost 40 years old	i think hes over 40
so why do you support them	i like rooting for an underdog besides the yankees have too many advantages
kevin spacey danny devito kim basinger guy pearce	ok ok everyone
sure ill pick it up at work tomorrow	alright you wont regret it whats your favorite jackie chan movie
all im saying is theres better quarterbacks out there like rodgers who havent had the advantage of having the best coach of all time	agree to disagree
no hes fairly old like in his 40s	how long has he been a dj
i guess for what it is i thought the turn to an outandout serial format was kind of cynical hey were onto a successful franchise lets just assume youre going to tune in next time	but it was successful i mean its a pretty good gamble to take that people will want to see the next movie even if it was jedi
the  whole  cd is well put  together	how    many  tracks  are there
i feel like theyll play until they cant even walk	how many superbowls have they been both in do you think
who am i forgetting	some guy named jj watt
it really opened a lot up a very gritty and almost fourth wall breaking film	sort of like how deadpool breaks the fourthwall
ill be interested where players go in the nba draft	yeah its really a great draft class
that sounds like a lot of different scales to learn for a musician	actually its not that bad most scales have the same patterns that just start and end in different places
i know what you mean summer drags on	i agree so ready for football season and the fall to get here
remember how the brew used to be the buzz my favorite concert and memory was one of the last buzzfests	which one
did the cowboys pick up some quality players in the draft this year	i think they did as they were definitely looking to fill holes in the defensive line
that was an excellent super bowl he would  have been a hero if the pass had worked though	i disagree this was one of the worst calls i have ever seen in football
it has a different sound but i really dig it	oh yeah
yeah up until he took the plunge into the atlantic ice bath	you know that movie was not only romantic like boy girl romantic it was period romantic
not here in the us  it debuted at sixteen but in japan it was really popular	oh thats kind of weird  is she from there
this is true music makes whatever i am doing less boring	i have to have music on as background noise
me too seen any recently	yes i saw one

i enjoy ring of fire	everyone knows that one

i watch the dictator last night	oh did you like it
awe man i forgot all about stupid girl remember the video	the video is what made me like the song

have you seen the 1970s movie the warriors	yes  it is one of my favorites

you never know	i guess i dont
and gal godot was in the fast and furious	hmmmstill not ringing any bells
who is your favorite nfl team	i love the cowboys what about you
well if it is my favorite i should play that but what instrument should i play	is their an instrument you seem to like
oh i know thats exactly what i expect from those movies	so in oculus did you enjoy the ending i was in the middle on how i felt about the ending for the longest time
for sure i was going to see if you wanted to come watch it but i guess not	yea thanks for the invite though
meaning	stick around and kill or be killed by his nephew or leave
yeah it is  most artists arent around so long	i know  i think theyve released something like 13 albums total
how many runs did they score in the 8th	they scored 5 runs
oh  i think i kind of remember the ads for that one  i didnt see it though	i wouldnt really bother  it certainly wasnt his best work
what do you dislike	hell throw in a bit of obscurantism and doesnt always finish what he started
have you seen frozen	yeah my daughter loves it
me either the beat is not as catchy	oh i dislike the lyrics
i like rey	me too
well okay which one do you like more then	after thinking i guess i would say episode 3 would be my choice
so to you who is the reigning king of pop music	its still gotta be michael jackson
i agree  i love the black muscle car the vins character drives around	i love the green honda  it is little but packs a punch
a lot of people my self included thought the same thing but apparently not	hey doesnt that mean shes officially a disney princess
i also like the part when his friend ask him to pitch and its so hard it goes through the net	yeah and this wonder bat of his  i like how a kid made one at the end
yes it was almost as good as the first i like dorys character	yes ellen is perfect for the voice
did you know that emmett smith also holds the record for the most career rushing touchdowns as well	yes he was an amazing player and athlete
was he known for hip hop or some other genres too	well he sang pop some rock and of course hip hop
did you not like the jungle book or beauty and the beast remakes	neither were terrible but hollywood is getting very unoriginal
her singing voice is so insanely beautiful and articulate and her speaking voice is so thuggish well at least at the time it was	thats funny that you got that impression
did you ever watch the fugitive	is that the one with harrison ford
it is a music one	based on who
it should be	yes i agree one hundred percent
well first of wentz is going to dominate	anything will be better than last year
what about the other stuff you mentioned	hes a good example his humor can be broad sometimes dark i like that about him

have you ever heard of mason jennings	no who is that
thats nuts	boston is nuts
yes its one of my favorites	my favorite from the 80s was the goonies
i did for a bit  i kindof already figured out that that guy was going to be his dad though	me too  tulsa was interesting  she really cared about him
can you believe how long star wars has existed	im actually not a fan so i really dont know much about it
why snoop  dogg	he is really funny and he is just living the life of a g all day every day
i guess maybe diehard fans would be interested even if its not an exotic city	exactly
i do too i love flynn ryder too his story is so great im glad he ends up happy and not a thief anymore	yeah i think rapunzel and flynn go together well he really helps her learn about who she is
i cant remember the last time i have seen a good comedy film	i know  i think the newer comedy films havent been anything special
i could you know i could go on and on about any team in the nfl	but the cowboys are your favorite have a good night
the beats really help me relax too	yeah it puts me in a flow state
i still cant believe harrison ford is doing another indiana jones movie i mean hes getting up there in age	i knowhes currently 74 years old
you should pick them up theyre great i saw them in concert too	they did a song with alanis morisette but i cant remember the name of it
just the suspense is killing me	why
yeah im kind of surprised you picked that movie given that some of the musical numbers were a little shaky	it definitely helps that i love the stories and songs to begin with from the stage productions
i know there are so many good movies to choose from	i think my favorite would have to be step brothers
i was going to do the same	you should swing by
really which ones has he done	he has some really good thrillers have you heard of blood work
its for the song the promise and was filmed before he died in may	why did they wait until now to release it
i like all of their stuff	i wish i could see them live
the warriors have really been dominating i hope they keep it up	i am sure they will they are a great team

yes they should given the talent level on the team	last year was  disappointing for them
what would you say is the best album released this year	thats hard to say so much good music has been released
thats what i heard didnt he win an oscar for his performance	i believe so michelle williams is also very good in it
they had another hit but i cant remember the name	youre probably thinking about without you it wasnt as popular
yeah they are even better than last year	i cant believe they got rid of blount after all he did for them
when i was in high school i used to listen to a very low wattage college radio station that played the birthday party which was his first band	oh yeah i love the birthday party
she is she had a lot of emotive songs	dope is a new song and it is heartbreaking
what was your favorite  recent thriller film	darren aronofskys black swan
yeah thats true sometimes it doesnt matter though	what do you mean
they were on the bet awards show	really did they sing candygirl
it really is a tale as old as time	its a classic for sure
then the rock said you better hide that big forehead	that was a really funny part
thats an interesting question	well
i love ashanti	and she is so pretty
that makes sense it totally has that feeling	i wonder if the original is also sad
thank you lord its almost football season again	oh cmon the mlb allstar game is tonight
yeah thats a great one	ive probbably seen it about 5 times
that is an excellent song	it sure is i listen to it all the time now
your right which songs should i add	free fallin and mary janes last dance are the first 2 that come to mind

can you see a fourth hangover movie being made	possibly but i dont know which actor would do it
what was the first disney movie you ever watched	snow white
when do the flyers pick	number 2
they have their place its all part of being a te	does tom brady have what it takes to win again
it was a devastating loss	it always is
funny  i was going to say the same thing	hes written all the classics
i hate to say it but i think theyll be pretty bad	i agree it all depends on andrew luck though he needs to carry this team
he is the one who convinces her to leave her home and come fight in the war to end all wars	well you have sole me im in
who do you like	i like the spice girls
sublime  once again i like a few songs of theirs but not as good as everyone says	i completely agree with that  the lyrics to their songs sound like what a 12 year old would write
i know it sometimes seems unfair to boys with all these princess themed movies	so true well let me know what you think about it after you see it
i agree	never gaga
yeah you are right about that too	i think it played on your head as well
hows that work	we custommake ipod shuffles with music from the teens and late 20s
me too	its the worlds best sport
no country for old men was a weird movie	weird  not the word id use
yes it had all the good elements and characters like the classic disney movies	what are some of the examples
yeah that is the one	was it any good
i dont think it will ever be that bad	do you have faith in their front office
who is your favorite comedic movie star	bill murray no doubt
hi	hey
i agree  give me 70s inspired fashion anyday	im more of an 80s gal myself those colors im also really loving the exposed bra trend
i think everyone loves elvis	my mom was addicted to him
have you heard of porcupine tree	what on earth no i havent care to explain
yeah no it wasnt plagiarism or anything wasnt survivor the first time beyonce tried to rap	i think so jayz influenced her
morgan freeman was the only one i recognized	wasnt that a wild ending
yeah ran over the bed	yeah oh man 90s rock and mtv
i think hbo has some good programming	yeah but their movie selection lacks most times
what do you think of the trend towards bell bottoms	my mother said she used to wear them in the 70s and they were very comfortable
haha	i only had 10 beers
okay okay name a thriller that had two characters going after each other and it has to be old school	whatever happened to baby jane with joan crawford and bette davis
her husband is trying to protect her from finding out shes a terrible singer	aww thats kind of sweet
i like country the best though	country is good
i do from time to time like i really liked the conjuring	the conjuring was good any others youve seen lately
you also got to worry about the cowboys defense	yeah they did a good job of drafting a lot of young talent though
i like the falcons again what about you	i cant decide man i want the falcons to win of course but new orleans is supposed to be much better this year
if they made a backstory movie on any character who would you want it to be on	obi wan kenobi because hes a very interesting character and id like to see him as a child and as he was training under gui gon
the yankees did beat the stros today and are playing the second game of a doubleheader	so do we have to root for the yankees
does she succeed	at first but youll have to watch it to find out
i just heard theyre making it rated r too so that made me even more excited	really thats great news  i feel like they held back a lot in the original
which teams do you like	i like the steelers i like the packers
its one of my favorite thriller movies  it stars ashley judd	i like ashley judd  i havent seen her in much lately
yes he is hes in every iron man movie suited as the chauffeur	thats funny chef was a really surprisingly good movie i didnt expect much from it sofia vergara played jons wife in the movie right
oh yea and kevin hart too right	yea it looks pretty funny
have you heard radioheads earlier stuff	no i have not
do you remember all that hassle when apple gave away their album for free	i do remember  i couldnt see what all of the fuss was about
who do you think will be the biggest letdown this season	im thinking the atlanta falcons as they had a great season last year but i think this one will be different
hes got such a gentle voice	i love that about him
it was a shame when he died him and vin diesel together made those movies	i know and to die in a car
yeah it really is interest kendrick really takes a dark long stare at his own race	is it negative to black people
do you like 90s music	yes
a whole group of my friends went to go see it at the theater	in my small town there was only one theater and the line to see star wars went all the way around the block
regardless i love the new song swish swish	haha blank space by taylor swift is still my number one
it was supposed to have been a war fabricated by sidious	the motives for the trade federation was a little unclear
yeah i guess the speculation around that is pretty fun	in the beginning of the season you get to have a nfl fantasy draft too and that comes with its own possibilities
absolutely i have been a ryan fan since he was with boston college	hes a tough guy this year will depend on his offensive line
its going to be shown at imax theaters	we should go
i wouldnt recommend you going to a film festival	i loathe them
yeah but a lot of the music is fairly timeless	isnt there a song called light my candle
yes i used to love the show when i was younger	oh the movie looks horrible
do you think jerry rice is the best nfl receiver ever	without a doubt
the patriots have him	wow he will do good on that team
it was a black comedy	about black people
its been a long time i dont remember that one as well	i want to grt my vhs player out and all my tapes now
the new one	no that was awful
just wondering  some people dont like it  whats your favorite	well i really enjoyed the harry potter series and american psycho
it was great i loved the action and the cinematography	was it very different from other kong movies
i care anyway i just dont like their rankings though	then you shouldnt care what are they using to rank them anyway
oh really why	its something about her voice that i just cant get into
that would have been satisfying but of course them getting together at the end is viewed more positively	im happy janine got her own place
you mean the whole irony of the veterinary school and how the main characters family was vegan but she turned into a cannibal upon her first taste of flesh	yeah it was funny kind of in a dark comedy way i kind of saw the ending coming but it was still a shock that left me speechless
well i just noticed you singing along to elenore rigby on the classicrock radio	so
whos going to win in the south	dallas has a awesome team
he is good but not sure as he is getting older	how about lesean mccoy
i wonder if the same characters are in this new movie	apparently tow mater lightning mcqueen and other cars from the first two movies are in this one as well
i got you do you know how many rebounds both teams had	yes south carolina had 36 rebounds and gonzaga had 41 rebounds
they were in the black  blue division back in the 60s right	yeah now its the pink no graylol
truei just want to be able to respect them still as great	well you can they are great just not truly original
you have to watch the playoffs that is when they play harder	ok i will do that
hes not as good of a quarterback	no but he seems like a better person
i also love the short film before the actual movie	oh the one with the rabbit
yes thats the one	well i actually liked the second one better
yeah i think if you filtered out all of the mediocre current stuff and only highlighted the great stuff itd be competitive with the supposed golden era of hiphop	true there are so many great records coming out that are bending genres and doing really cool things from chance 3 to the life of pablo
who is touring with hall and oates this summer	it is the british group tears for fears
alright	cool
thats a rare one you dont find too many jabba fans out there	true i dont think i have ever met another jabba fan myself
with adam sandler right	yes he is rhe star of that movie
i agree  moreland is okay but nowhere near the power	and we already had hanley at first base
what does that mean	most of the metal sound revolves around a distorted guitar sound and the music the guitarists play
who is the greatest super bowl championship team of all time	easy da bears
wow i didnt know this	i suggest you check out weird scenes inside the canyon laurel canyon covert ops  the dark heart of the hippie dream by  david mcgowan
linebacker and he is a good one and that is where arizona needed some improvement is on defense	where did he play college football
i guess well see how long it to you remix the song	and i should take maybe a day or two ill send it to you
did you know chris cornell from soundgarden just recently died	yeah i heard about that that was pretty sad
why is that it was good to have his background explained	well it means that youre no longer that afraid of him and his status as a psychopath with no cause sort of disappears
or maybe they will add in her death into this film	i feel like the audience wont want leia to die in the films it feels like too much
i wish they came out with another one	maybe they ran out of secrets
really i didnt know you liked hard rock and metal	i sure do my favorite thing about metallica is the singer
he says things other people would be scared to say	i know
well people already made remix of it	have you heard the gospel version of it
yeah but we should go see it i love mulan	that sounds good im interested in seeing it in theaters
another musical i like is sweeny todd	ive heard of it but have never seen it
i know the bears have so many holes at several positions	tons of holes and little experience across the board
stefani is a wierd first name	it really is
compared to other types of entertainment thats very unimpressive	yes it is
i tend to steer away from anythink dark depressing or scary	i might suggest dan in real life ive watched it several times already
i just got a spotify account can you recommend some new artists for me	sure im really into ed sheeran these days
okay wise guy why do you like the nolan films	i just think the social commentary and the cohesiveness of the storyline is so on point
come to think of it he may be my favorite country singer	yea he is really talented he seems like a great guy as well
yeah i know who youre talking about they will be ready in 2018 but not yet	all the division games in the east will be tight
do you like the beatles	yes of course
it takes place at christmas that makes it a christmas movie	fine name me one other christmas movie with guns and explosions in it if you can do that ill admit die hard is a christmas movie
i still think rogue one was better	better than what
but you know what i think is one of the most illogical things in the star wars universe	what
oh yeah thats right	they were both in tarantinos earlier movie resevoir dogs
im a cowboy fan from way back in the day  what about you	broncos  been one since elway started for them
they finally got lucky with the pingpong balls in the draft	it is a relief who are they going to take lorenzo ball
okay i will check them out	cool definitely give their old music a listen too
neil patrick harris  tyler perry were particularly excellent in the film	ben affleck was one of the stars too right
i think she wants to direct bands	right now the best thing you can do is to get an education degree with a strong theory background
whats the type of music that you listen most often	its definitely hip hop
yeah they just released an album	awesome whats it called
my tastes havent changed in what i like	mine either its just determinate on my mood as to what i want to listen too
because it feels like they make nothing new	but they do

no its still a mystery there are a number of theories there was some heavy fog and they think the wings might have iced up and they crashed in the channel a bomber group was also returning after having to abort their mission because of the weather and it was standard procedure to drop their bombs into the english channel rather than risk landing with a full bomb load and the bombers were coming over the same area of the english channel as glenns plane was going in the opposite directions so they think if glenns plane was flying low splashes from the bombs or the concussions from them couldve knocked him down	ill have to look him up as well sounds like a fascinating story when i go home tonight im really in the mood to put some of their music on again
they play it on the raido a lot	hm ill have to look it up

well many songs demonstrate her talent and skill as a singer	that is true
that move looks so cool	yes and danny mcbride is starting i it
it has a crazy good cast with john goodman afleck and bryan cransten	thats probably why it won best picture

kind of	well hes the guy making the final calls
fun times anyway back to the yankees hes a right fielder he smacks homers	how good is he like is he powerful

yes 9194 they lost to dallas twice washington and the giants	nfc east can be a bear
the fret marks yes it does but you need to press cleanly in the space so that the note plays true on the one long string vibration	sort of like when you play a larger string instrument like the cello

they are really good	ill look into them
ever seen the natural	yes  that movie was really good
yeah that was brutal coming from his own son	his facial expressions during the last fight with rey were interesting
well thats true	have you heard of willie nelson
yeah i know that king diamond has a heavy classical influence and they mainly do scary metal	oh very strange im sure some of my bands have classical influences too
i have not heard of that is it similar to the twilight zone	yes in fact the director isaac ezban was partially inspired by that show
no i think they took that down after your little adventure its peggy lee singing while benny goodman plays the clarinet	who are these people

pete rose is a perfect example	oh yes the rose
it was great and in this one he actually died at the end	thats a surprise

still rooting for the packers	yup once a cheesehead always a cheesehead

the draft is supposed to be used to build a roster up not to gamble on a high risk quarterback	i wouldnt call trubisky high risk but the bears dont have the right system to support his development

exactly or homeward bound	i loved homeward bound as a kid so much
well it doesnt hurt i heard that david fincher may be directing the sequel to wwz	that would be awesome i loved wwz

that was a good year	yes forrest gump came out that year too
oh so many helen wheels was one of my favorites when he played with wings	what others
i hear alot of people compare them but i think they do with that with alot of black artists that kinda have a kinda earthy look but there songs are diffrent	is her album worth buying
why do you say that	darth couldnt sense his own daughter in the same room as him thats kind of sad
he is cool i guess though	nah anselmo is beast
anything else	the clarinets blowing on their mouthpieces in the middle made no sense it was weird for the sake of weird

are you excited for the upcoming season	i always am
huh didnt she have a single come out recently for it	yeah chained to the rhythm
why would they do that	since its a gamble film wonder woman is a well known but never had her own movie
well might be fun	it will
thats just when they were starting to transcend their teenybopper pop roots i prefer their later more psychedelic stuff like sgt peppers	i enjoy that too but some of that stuff is too far out there for me i like the songs where lennon and mccartney seem to work together well
yeah that was amazing  probably the most well written part of the whole series	and it shows you the true scope of dumpledores genius
i really want to watch walle again	why
they need a couple of more pieces though	yeah i agree with you they have to add some shooters
theres nothing more therapeutic than music though	thats true currently that whole album is on my playlist
i just hope its not very long	did you search the movie
what about biggy	man aint no one like biggy
oh yeah i love him	they both had amazing chemistry
i know that sometimes people flip out if another crew member like moves a cup when theyre not supposed to	it sounds ridiculous but its kind of like civil litigation  you need to protect your space or else other people will take it over and claim precedent for when you failed to stop someone before
i think hes got one more in him just like bettis	i miss jerome bettis
that is a good choice that way it isnt all country songs	yes and you could also choose some songs by rod stewart

oh the guy with blonde hair	yes thats the one
julia also wrote ed sheerans dive gwen stefanis “used to love you” and selena gomezs good for you	that is quite the resumé  good for you actually makes sense because stylistically they are sort of similar

i am always fascinated to tune into a basketball when they are in the play offs do you	i too am fascinated by the play offs though i also watch extensively lots of games leading up to the play offs

i wonder who came up with the idea for darth mauls double bladed lightsaber	yeah that was pretty epic when he ignited it during the final phantom menace dual

what	ben folds has an acapella version of a lot of his songs
does maroon 5 actually have only five members on their band	not really they actually have seven members i dont know why they have a 5 in their name
i cant believe it was 20 years ago it debuted	i remember the scenes very vividly
he did but as he matured he realized the reasons and the reality of the situation	thats a good point

did you ever watch shutter island	no what is it about
i love her song this ones for the girls	me too

any one that stands out as the worst	the second one or third one is pretty bad
how hard do you think it would be to rap about the eiffel tower	thats kind of ambigious
yes it was it kind of helped to lay the scene for the movie	that would defiitely help a band
yeah but its a really good movie about a serial killer who kills virgins to capture the scent	what
its the sweet how much is that doggie in the window type stuff	i guess then that my favorite early rock and roll music would be elvis presley
have you heard the latest coldplay song	yes you must mean the song something just like this with the chainsmokers it has done very well on the charts this week

gal gadot did wonderful as wonder woman	was that a pun
they have done so many good songs together as well	she also went on tour with eminem and did quite a few songs with him as well
they did surfin usa came out in 1963 i think and berrys song had been out since 1958	i remember george harrison getting sued for supposedly copying hes so fine
hes a heck of a player but im not sure hes 1	then who would you pick
absolutely and to think critics of the time were so confused by them	yeah no one had ever been quite like them before took awhile to grow on people
who backs up wilson this year	you mean besides ciara i bet the seahawks sign colin kaepernick

i had high expectationsbut they came crashing down pretty quick	i thought kelly was a home run hire when i first heard the news

do you like them more than nsync	yes i do
have you seen the new star wars movie	which one rogue one or the force awakens
you know him	im trying
i disagree on both points von miller is the most dominant defensive player in both the afc west and the nfl	von miller is good but hes helped too much by other players in denvers defense
okay so who was your favorite 80s rock band	thats a tough one foriegner chicago journey loverboy
how cool	it was but sort of sucked i mean it was eight dollars for a beer
changing his stance on the national anthem thing made him look flakely	he has decided to stand now to would increase his chances of getting hired
like tonic foo fighters those types of bands	yeah my favorite band is foo fighters
everything she does is perfect	bjork had a heartbreaking album a few years ago

yes and the special effects are really good in this one	i bet a lot better than when the first one came out i imagine
i like the orioles	im a fan of the braves
some aggressive rock music	so is it hardcore

i actually like drake a lot	i respect that i just dont think its god  it is nothing like the real rap of the old days

you dont think he deserves to be in the conversation	nope i think if he wouldve had the same career without the controversy wed have that conversation

yes she was fun in that one	who directed the movie
i never read the original novel but edgar rice borroughs must be spinning in his grave	theres a visual for you

someone else whos really stepping up is j cole	really i wasnt sure if he was any good
you missed nothing	youre an idiot
what are you doing	i am just observing some stuff on old videos
actually all of the nfl decisions are made by a board of trustees and all money in the nfl goes to preserving this organization	so its like a private company in a sense

yeah i will agree if you say that	i would have to say maybe casino
who is your favorite solo drum or percussion act	phil collins its simply incredible what he can do on his own with such a wide variety of percussion instruments

like what	like killswitch engage
if you search mf doom on youtube there should be other artist like him in the list of results	im going to search and find others who share his style i enjoyed it very much

yeah the unique special work of genius starring brad pitt that i watched last night was called cool world	that movie was so bad it only got 4 on rotton tomatoes  so maybe that really was just another movie

he loves the game clearly	we dont know that money is a motivator
yea i didnt think you knew about that	yea i actually listen to a lot of anime music
oh for sure i think my favorite aspect of the movie is the atats on hoth they are just so cool and iconic	i know exactly what you mean they really allow the notion of how powerful the empire real is to hit home
it doesnt help that a good chunk of the old cast wont be returning how do you think itll end	no idea thats both good and bad
they do sign them on for many movies	if they appear for just a scene it counts as a movie for them
i think the rockets would have done better if james harden played better tonight	yes he played well during the regular season but did not perform as well during the playoffs
you should id come	great then i will then

and what about modern	awa is awesome so is omer adam and moshe peretz
what you up to though	nothing much just watching the classic coming to america
which one is that one	her song bad blood when i listen to it it brings me back to what my exboyfriend and i went through i remember reciting the lyrics to him at one point

i agree	it was great talking to you
so what do you think dc will do with him	just keep having him in the movies that star others
i wonder if any of that stuff is true	some of it is he does have a small flat he did give 80 ill fro his 114 mil earning from matrix series to the staff
i watched patriots day this weekend	i didnt think it showed enough action
he has a new song out though	isnt it love in the air
no matter what itll be cool to play in the new stadium	mercedesbenz

no arguments there i had no idea prometheus was a prequel for the alien movies	it was ive never even seen prometheus
the bengals had some good teams back in the 80s	yes they did kenny anderson and boomer esiason were great quarterbacks
they should make a movie with all three jokers in it	you just blew my mind
not really though my sister knows some good indie bands	indie whats that

the panthers might have it in them	lets hope so
what did she listen to	chained up a lot
yeah those are the ones	classics
and they are playing some of the worst stuff	what are they playing
what song do you recommend the most from her	i think wrecking ball is cool
i definitely think its the best of the new set of dc superhero films	it was certainly better than batman vs superman
yeah she sounded great but her outfit was crazy	you have to admit it was a little more toned down than some of her other looks

thats my favorite part	haha  why
i have not how is he	he is fantastic
at one point i did when he was confessing	turns out he was just having a meltdown but he went right back to his old self
well at least the way lolita leaves is somewhat due to the fact that she was having an affair with whatshisname	yes but in mr church its the absence of intimacy that causes the girl to leave and then gets into an accident which ends up
flopped	yeah his three year stint with the raiders ended up being a complete waste for the organization they got nothing out of him

what does that mean	i guess youll have to watch and see
they are already 8 games behind the astros for the division	yeah but the astros are playing out of their mind right now the season is still young
you should come by	yeah i want to hear them
hmm thats a hard one  i love escape from new york but id have to say halloween hands down	i never saw escape from new york  whos in that

what team has the best color	what sport
what is it called	inception
i was surprised when i found that out  i remember pictures of him on tiger beat magazine when he was a teenager	he did a great job though  i guess you never know
why is it that every time i come into your room you are listening to some 80s song	because i like the music that was a great musical decade
yeah	that was an awesome song
i bet	i think there are tons of good live bands
they knew who he was and what he was capable of before they drafted him	he had enough off the field problems to scare most teams away pats are all about winning

so what is your favorite right now	i just saw lego batman it was hilarious
oh yeah the music was really weird	do you remember one alien playing the saxophone what the heck
it almost was	by who
who directed it	orson welles
no doubt that game was amazing it has to be one of the most historic nfl games ever	for the patriots to come back from a 25 point deficit was one of the greatest things i have ever seen in football
daniel snyder you bet hes micromanaging the team into oblivion	hows the new coach working out
do you have a favorite elvis song	i really like in the ghetto

say it	come over and watch some halloween with me
yes it really adds something special when the lyrics are optimistic and telling a great story like that	yes it is super fun too
im listening to it now on my spotify want to listen with me	sure
thats pretty funny	yeah my mom riding around singing a lil wayne song
thats a good point  pretty much no one in the core group besides han died	remember that scene in fast five where dom and brian drive off a bridge and survive
wow so its a pretty good show and pretty elaborate then	yes and they have all kinds of props to do with the songs also  the girls sometimes are in these mountain things and they come out over the course of the song
yes they are making	i have to see this

yeah hes still playing at a high level	eventually he wont be and they need to fix the problem
those were the days	good cartoons and good tv
if you want to see some really enjoyable animated ones like those then id recommend chicken little big hero 6 and zootopia for something more live action tomorrowland mcfarland usa and into the woods are absolute must see movies	she also highly recommended into the woods so i think ill start with it how can i not with the likes of meryl streep emily blunt johnny depp james corden richard glover chris pine and tracey ullman in it

i dont know he seems like he still has some years ahead of him	yeah i guess
yeah how you know  you seen it already	no its just the title says it all seem like youll be a boring movie
yeah it only shows lightning mcqueen crashing and thats it	i think they are bringing back most of the characters from the first one  though
i am sure he will be racking in the profits	i would be laughing if i were him these two movies are probably going to sell so many tickets
does that have will ferrel in it	yes it does
theyll take any thing and turn it into an instrument like a toaster or a toothbrush	that seems odd
i havent heard it yet what is it called	it is called redbone it is a great song

not to mention pretty funny	yea his songs are hilarious

id say connery craig and roger moore	i disagree on roger moore
you know how i constantly make bambi jokes ive never seen bambi	your secret is safe with me your jokes always made sense so i never questioned it
either one of them can take over a game though i dont think either is better than the other	both of them play better at home since this one is in boston i think isaiah will be the better player
but remember to go check it out in imax please its just damn blowing	oh take it easy man i am sure gonna check it out
probably a good call too many hero movies and black adam would make a much more interesting story	plus it helps to set the stage and build even more anticipation for shazam
wait really i honestly didnt know that	yeah but they havent put out an album in years
i think the actress they wanted back out	i heard they are doing a lion king one too
me too johnny depp is hilarious in that role	kiera knightley was good in those films as well as orlando bloom

that was a funny scene another funny thing was when they are getting squished in the trash compactor	and they try to stop the machine with a long pole
i think disney did jumanji didnt they thats another one robin williams was good in	i heard theyre supposed to be coming out with another one this year
no one will even remember most of these musicians years from now they will remember a few like taylor swift or beyonce	yes those who have really made a name for themselves
i know who do you like this year	you know me i am a patriots fan all the way
i wonder if they make you act it out if you go	i hope not but i guess wed have to see
yes i dont remember that whole movie too much	i think saving private ryan was my favorite
i hope his next track is as hotb a this one	me too i hope his video is as long as the last one
why do you say so	wizkid had been known as starboy for over 5 years before weekend did this new song starboy and then starts saying hes the real starboy
yes its sounds like heavy metal rock	yeah but with an rnb feel
yes it still holds its own for sure	i think its probably one of keanu reeves best movies too
what broadway theme is your chorus concert built around this year we are singing many songs from hairspray	i thought your concert would focus on hamilton songs my favorite is my shot
a man gets a creature	it is called a mogwai
oh i did not know she did that	yeah definitely check it out
yoda darth vader snow base cloud city it had it all	yes and dont forget lando
yeah definitely me too	who will you be cheering for this season
im not sure	so someone who bats 225 hits 15 homeruns and strikes out 200 times shouldnt make 10 million right
whats your favorite tune of theirs	i love dreams
i use that all the time	yeah me too thats probably why i dont get more dates
i like all rock music equally although i will agree that lacey has an amazing voice	do you prefer hard rock or soft rock
yeah but it seems like theyre everywhere in every advertisement for the movie	well yeah they should be theyre kind of important in the story
they are constantly trying to see girls and they are always trying to dodge this one teacher who is trying to catch them all the time	that sounds interesting
thats not very specific	well i mean they have rock guitar stuff and ambient sounds
what are your must have items for summer this year	i really want a shorts jumper i saw kim kardashian wearing it so trendy
thats pretty old i wonder what notes it makes	thats a great question not sure they should really do a study on the pitch of the flute it will be so interesting
if they have that kind of start hes going to need to considering benching him	what are options do you they have
it didnt say that in the movie	i know they arent in order
i would contend that john mayers faster tempo songs like no such thing or his slower songs like daughters are superior to your mentioned ed sheeran songs	agree to disagree maybe its a generational thing
its such a sad loss of potential like you said about john the drugs stop you from seeing all they could have done	you would think hollywood would see this and try to do more to help movie stars from going down that path
it just spoke to the audience at the end	people are depressed i guess
and you dont mind that	no not really
i know they have a pretty good pitching staff	there hitting is also very good
its amazing how he can act and sing	yes being a dual threat is amazing
sounds good have you ever heard of sylvan esso	i think so but im not positive why
they bought marvel too so theyre in charge of all the superhero films pretty much	yep every superhero except the dc universe ones which is pretty much just batman and superman
i sing how far ill go everyday	people are so sick of me singing it at this point
thats true we just have to appreciate what we have in those movies	yes we do
yeah that was a classic movie	wax on wax off
they set the tone in this movie though they knew there was supposed to be a big shootout instead they showed us a massacre	see i want to see it now so that i can make some fair comparisons i think youre exaggerating the issue
1991 i was only 6 years old	do you want to hear some fun facts about the movie
who is your favorite band of all time	my favorite band of all time is the ramones
yeah nothing beats disney films there timeless	i agree these films really bring people together
well it is sort of bad	then why are you watching it
did it really jump start anyones career	not really
i havent seen that one isnt it old	yes but it is very creative and full of suspense
that one was so good	i didnt like the brown hair on the princess
logan	ahh that is right
i am excited lets watch it	i will get the popcorn
i think even having two of them would not have been as bad	topher graces venom just wasnt menacing
what did you think of it	well all the star war movies are great but this one wasnt at all what i had expected
i love lace i think that would look great maybe even with a bit of sparkle	sparkles is always great just dont go too overboard that gets scratchy feeling and you dont want to be uncomfortable
i could listen to the soundtrack all day	me too i think i loved this version of gaston the most
oh yeah  robin williams as the genie he stole the show for sure	yeah  what about you
quests are the ultimate plot haha	remember quest for camelot
i agree with that	i dont know if theyll score a lot
everyone was standing up and cheering	i get to go to the next game so i hope i get to see something like that
yes he was fantastic	he played snowden so well
a bit cheeky to cite player safety as a reason for a rule change but not consider dropping thursday night football	i agree but i bet those thursday night games get them more money
yep  it had a great tune and funny lyrics	yeah i really like that one too
do you miss him	yeah he was going to teach me his native language
yes i mean the character he plays not the actor	i wonder how the plot will progress
i see	in xmen 3 they did the phoenix story and totally botched it up
amazing how an entire movie can take place in a plane	yeah and it kept you interested too
what band do you like the best when it comes to country name just one	hmm if i have to name one then i would have to say george strait
yeah it was great when did that come out	2003 i think
i had a different perception for them i was surprised by their new album culture	which song did you liked the most
well she was in the last three fast  the furious movies	oh i have seen those they are a lot of fun
its an easy tale to tell	that doesnt sound promising
one of the most famous scenes in film noir	or infamous
yeah	what is there to talk about queen
really thats adorable	i thought it was cool that they had a star and they were cowboys and stuff
danny glover isnt donald glovers dad	are you sure i swear someone told me that
why i know you hate a lot of things though	i never wanted to do it but it got me out of the house and sort of socializing
that has to be a wonderful combo i loved him on saturday night life	that was some of his best work you should check this out though
sounds great i am ready to watch	i hope you enjoy them like i think you will
well its hard to ignore that	i guess but they did have a good chance to be at the top
who was your favorite beatle	mccartney
i enjoyed what i did read	thats good
and that makes it beautiful	the fact that theres so much space in the music lets you really hear whats going on
did you live in a small town	yes and it was very conservative and the 70s so for a lot of us it was our first rock music concert experience
i do too ive been a big fan since the other boleyn girl	she was amazing in that i also loved her in lost in translation
i guess thats when beatlemania started	wonder when they came to the us
so was tipi hedren	yesand a real young suzanne pleshette
are you planning to go to any games	i havent decided yet  how about you
the score is very eerie	it definitely adds to the feeling of being unsettled by something
nirvana and soundgarden are two of my favorite bands	whats your favorite soundgarden song
yeah that was a great move for your team	i thought it was so cool that he said he would only to come play for us
well i guess you can blame the nflpa for that	they are largely responsible but players share some of the blame as well
i have been to 4 of her live shows	wow that is quite a bit
i guess you can take them out of the bad ends of town but still cannot get the thug out of them	i blame the coach
exactly  so they reshot the end to make him more measured	sounds like it was a smart move
they are so adorable	i agree
i think they did okay but they had some key players hurt last year which cost them	yeah they went from the super bowl to the toilet bowl last year
oh what thats on netflix now	yeah its a classic every time its on tv i have to watch it well it turns out thats true of me seeing it on netflix too what about you
thats right did you see her in dolores claiborne	yes that one was just as good in my opinion shes such a good actress
besides the first three star wars movies filmed have harrison ford mark hamill and carrie fisher cant get better than that	i guess they dont hurt anything
you have to see it its about a guy who tries to get home for thanksgiving and he ends up traveling with this crazy guy	whos in it
thats right kind of weird now i think about itpanthers	yeah with the cry baby qbwhats his name
do you have a favorite song	probably cant stop the feeling
miami is in the same boat	so teamwize its pretty much equal
oh yes  i loved how he got free	ted levine was cool as buffalo bill
i thought he was a little out of place honestly	i guess we have to agree to disagree there
what do you think of this new line that luke in the next star wars is over the whole jedi thing	i think it means he means to bring balance
sure i can see that	same with video games
im to poor	your not poor
i personally think rogers is a better quarterback	his accuracy is deadly and he has mobility too
gotta always think positive	i guess
we still havent seen it i think shes upset with me about it	well yeah no kidding that movie was great
i think he will have a bigger role	what about black panther
thats a shame i always liked sir paul	yeah  maybe hes changed i guess my favorite would be ringo
thats true maybe they could get someone who sounds like him	i bet most of his script was adlibbed
i think he did  it was one of his bigger projects to that date	i remember val kilmer was also in it
i do to and with work and all i do not get the chance to very often	i know what you mean i have been wanting to watch the new transformer movie but have not got the chance to
that is hilarious i love that one too	yea they were all great in that film
no i only know current stuff	do you know taylor swift
did you hear the new song by katy perry	is it the song calledroar
also in the force awakens when rey and chewbaca come back after han solos death leia gives rey a hug but not chewbaca	thats interesting rey just met han and didnt know him well but chewbaca and been hans best friend and partner for many years
yes and the world series the year before	well the royals won it that year and they are even worse i think
oh i heard that song	i like it
that should be a great time let me know how it goes and if he enjoys it	i will go cards
what do you like about christmas movies	everything they are so heartwarming
so it was reverse discrimination	i think the movie put the guys out there alot more
i think he stays until they end the universe	you may be right but probably not
thats a good point but it still feels slightly bloated to me its also a very heavy listen and can be incredibly depressing depending on what mood youre in	thats what makes it a brilliant work of art that paranoia malaise and uneasiness seep into every second of the album
it didnt do as well as they had hoped	probably because theyre simply not very good movies
maybe she was comparing it to frozen  i heard a lot of people were	maybe  i personally loved the songs in moana
i like that one too	well it was nice to talk to you
oh i see and have you been to any good concerts lately	yes i have i went to a rock concert
i guess it is affiliated with disney	but its not a full movie
the love story seemed forced too	yeah the characters are clearly going to get together but it became a will they wont they scenario
what did you think of the harry potter series	it sucks
i guess not many i dont get much time to watch movies	oh so how come you have time right now
true so whats it about	well its a horror and the whole idea is that saying the name the bye bye man alerts him to you which you dont want and that the more you try not to think of it the more you do think of it
not as brutally honest as that coach for the buccaneers back in the 1970s	who was that
so you have to admit they are one of the greatest bands in history	no i dont they are one of the most overrated bands in history theyre songs are so simple just like childrens songs or like someone singing in the shower
i am frustrated	why are you frustrated
im sitting here listening to barry white on the secret garden	awe man that thing is fire quincy jones outdid himself when he put that together
look for an acustic concert they did some years ago	how will i know which concert it is there is too much stuff on the internet
definitely because once you understand different batters strengths and weaknesses and you know the pitchers as well their game becomes much more exciting	isnt it just throwing the ball and trying to hit it over and over again
i wouldnt have minded a bit of both	how would you get tickets
oh but its not like classical piano or anything like that	whats so special about it
yes that and the part with the little girl who kept appearing to the little boy	i dont know if i could handle a gift or curse like being able to see dead people it would drive me nuts
and	the one about dumbledores army
have you seen any good funny movies lately	yes i sure did yesterday it was hilarious
he produced that song stunt queen by block party	really i love that song
i thought it was pretty good	i havent seen it yet i was afraid theyd take the baby groot thing too far
have you been following the news about the intelligence investigation into trumps contacts with russia	i much prefer to focus on fictional rather than real intelligence operations have you seen the new bourne movie
he is working with jadakiss so hopefully he could get his foot in the door	nino man just released a mixtape a few days ago called better late than never it has some nice tracks on it
very	i heard there is a 28 weeks later as well lets watch that after
its hard to say nowadays many athletes turn to these kinds of drugs to improve their game	for his sake i hope hes telling the truth
yeah or what is it called	kingsman the secret service
you should you like alan rickman right	yeah hes in the series
yep only time will tell who makes it to the big game this year	it should be a fun season regardless of who wins it all but im rooting for any team besides the patriots
its always disappointing when star players from college wipe out in the nfl	yeah i agree theres so much pressure
how many wins do the pittsburgh steelers have i always heard that the oakland raiders have the most	that is so not true the raiders have 410 while the steelers have 529 since their first game
who is in it	well its directed by darren aronofsky and scored by clint mansell a great duo
yup the titans are going to look even better on it	the tennessee  titans have had a few good years since getting that new quarterback
the movie made no sense why did she not just wear gloves the whole time	she was a kid she did not know any better
yes thats the reason	i love jeremy
buffalo	lets go buffalo
with whom did you go there	i went there with my friends
i havent heard of that song	definitely listen to it
im pretty sure like 2 or 3 years ago	yeah something like that
hey jon how are things	not too bad just getting my playlist together for my workout
what do you think of boys to men	i like their songs
but i really like younger brazilian musicians too like marisa monte chico cesar carlinhos brown etc	oh i love that album tribalistas that monte and brown did together
close  it was about a north korean and south korean detective teaming up to catch some villains	oh that sounds interesting  what genre was it
oh that sounds like fun what are you guys gonna see	thats the problem i have no idea
it is about a guy who can breathe underwater the entire earth is flooded with water	that sounds pretty cool can everyone breathe underwater
what part of iowa she is planning to move	did she even move yet
he is good	yeah and bob dylan
yes and the sequel as well	there was a sequel to trainspotting
trimming the roster	that could be the way to stop with all the relievers
ok i will get the beer cold for the game	cool remember i only drink the good stuff haha ok see you friend at the next series game
i thought that the young actors did a fine job though	i agree felicity jones is a great up and coming actress
but the ravens responded with a field goal	the pats finally got the go ahead touchdown
how so	well in addition to rock music hes also influenced electronic music
yes i remember hearing that too because the mechanical shark did not work too often they had to come up something else	that is correct and therefore steven spielberg then had to have the shark implied
yes and matthew modine  its incredibly ridiculous and i love it	okay i guess bad pirate movies must really do it for you
hey remember when we used to go to the movies all the time together	yeah those were the good old days
you still like the hard rock music	i still do but i listen to more of a variety of music today
did you ever see any classic rock bands live	i saw aerosmith that is it
if it wasnt for the great acting it couldnt have happened	thankfully it did
laurel and hardy get the credit and thats only right but a lot of praise has to go to the bald guy too	the one with the funny eye and mustache
is it on itunes	yes it is
the store	yeah
i would rare mickeys just slightly higher i was a mess man	i can picture you in a corner a blubbering mess
he did what	yup thats it haha oh man antonio freeman i really like those nostalgic mediocre players that people kinda forget about these days
yes it appears to be the most popular genre with todays youth	i think thats because its real
that would definately be a good concert	im sure his concerts must have been awesome
do you know hes married to a country artist	yes hes married to faith hill  i love her music too  i wish she was still churnign out hits like she used to
yes he was with them for i believe 2 years he comes with rave reviews	that is great the eagles added matt mcgloin to their qb roster
raiders won 35 to 34	oh no i fell asleep before the game came on
those are all great movies	yeah know what my favourite part of nightmare before christmas is though
yeah  thats the one	sure ive seen it but its been a while
metallica guns n roses that category	well i bet that can keep you energized just like my house music does
ben harper is a fabulous guitar player hes a terrific singer and his live shows are always amazing	he plays such a wide variety of genres it keeps it from being boring he can switch back and forth from a blues song to a rock song to a reggae song and it all seems to blend together perfectly
they dont ever get it but when they do they kill	yeah they love that
im thinking if he stays healthy yes hes currently behind 9600 points to match jabbars record and hes 499 games behind jabbar	how long has lebron been playing 13 years
yeah	i would probably say kiss
i also really liked baloo and bagheeras banter a lot	yeah those two were really great in their performance
yes they are	are they still the same members
is it really as good as they say	i loved every second of it ryan reynolds is perfect as it
i still like under pressure the best	same i didnt like bobby tarantino or incredible story
so you dont really like like country music	no i dont find myself listening to it what about you what do you like or hate
wow i wonder what that version would have been like	i think if they had run with it anyway it probably would have been a good niche film
youre welcome its a cute song honestly way more catchy and danceable than monster mash	im excited to listen to it
thats all you need but why wouldnt you want to watch alien and aliens	i like aliens more than alien
i thought there was more to it than that	no thats pretty much it  they have a bunch of bizarre escapades while theyre there
i watched the special feature that showed that all the space scenes were just a toy and a box with a backgroun but somehow they look so much better then the new movies	i think the new star wars movie are more cgi then anything and i cant stand jar jar binks
the pitching has also been solid tis year	who would of thought they would be coming through likethey are
ya they did look good but will they learn from there mistakes	i think they will
that the super bowl this year will be held in minnesota	i had no idea thats so exciting
no we didnt even make the playoffs last year  it was a down year for sure	that must have been disappointing after a super bowl win huh
could you imagine him being in a romantic movie	that would be hard after seeing sons of anarchy and pacific rim
i think leia was hotter for her time	well padme had better outfits
they had the black album followed by their white album	well nobody calls it that though
did you ever see jaco pastorius when he was with weather report	no just heard the cds
i remember they beat the buffalo bills in the super bowl	i remember that game the buffalo bills went to four straight super bowls they never could win one though
viva la vida	oh cool
oh yea i forgot about that one he has so many classics	yes he does i just wished he was still around to come up with fresh hits
lets talk about mel gibson	oh man thisll get dark
what kind of band was led zepplin	they were a rock band
okay okay	sorry they were both good
true but you can always go back to the well	the genie voice would not be the same
have you heard her new album joanne	yes i especially like the song million reasons
i still remember the height of pop music	when was that
oh its out already	yeah man it came out on may 5th
did you know there is a new incredibles movie coming out	yes actually i did i think its coming out next year
who is the favorite to win the super bowl this year	i havent see but im guessing the patriots
what do you mean	well from what weve seen in the movies its this huge scifi city and i believe thats pretty much all weve seen of it  i just love the fact that its all busy and advanced
i believe it is dylan sprouse	hey i think you are right  what is your favorite part of the movie
i just dont know how you do a sequel to that kind of movie	neither do i it was cut and dry
yeah it is just kinda grating	why is it grating
i even loved the music video of catalyst	yes the music video was very thoughtful
okay i will be ready	good
did you	yes
yeah kenny g was a bit cheesy but i loved earl klugh and had all his albums	me too what was your favorite piece
i do not think it would be possible	is it funny is itt quirky
they have some great young players though i think theyll be tough	they have a tough schedule though but you never know
but you can score on defense and most times its flashier than an offensive score	ha because its such a magnificent play to strip your opponent of his goal and run it in their faces
freddy and jason have nothing on him	i definitely agree with this
it does have a good melody i suppose	oh and of course i like just the way you are
i agree more designers should cater to all body types what about the plus size model who is out now	yes i love her she looks good in everything i saw her in a versace dress the other day
i totally get it i am too when you finished 79 the past three seasons you cant overly excited	unfortunately i do tend to get overly excited and it seems to always lead to disappointment
whos your favorite beattle	probably george harrison why do you ask
i think he mostly got roles because of his reputation	i agree but it was neat seeing him in them
but not as much as dominic	of course not
yeah they are far from it	pretty much
yes the same concept	i like that kind of storyline
which was what	dont turn to the dark side it will cost everything you love and destroy you in the end
remember back when classic rock was all they played on mtv	yes that was when all they did was play music videos
i see theres yet another transformers movie coming out	is there really
ive been trying to track down older beatles albums which ones would you recommend me tracking down first	my favorites been abbey road but sgt peppers lonely hearts club band is awesome too
i am glad to hear it i have been listening to them a lot	i have not heard their music in years though
oh okay cool	nice chatting to you
yea true i just find it hard to think someone is good when they are on a team i hate	well thats just narrow minded
was it a solo concert	no i wasnt that good we performed with the boston brass
who do you think your favorite professor would have been	i dont know thats a hard one probably hagrid so we could get into trouble
no	you need to listen to that one
no i want to win the money they are not going to make the playoffs	i see head before heart
hes one of my favorites too my favorite is jack nicholson though	hes right up there with me too
what do you mean	i dont really have anything against him i just believe that a lot of his beliefs are wrong
watching some pre season on nfl	sounds tight
those are classics	i know arent they
how are the bears treated when they go to green bay	packer fans are very knowledgeable 999 are well behaved
no what did he say	he said he was pimping it and that we have seen it from him enough
are you looking forward to the next star wars movie	you bet i thought force awakens was a fantastic start to the new trilogy
are any of those teams still around	yes there are two of the founding teams still in existence
no doubt  so what winds up happening	well shes in this huge creepy house and strange things keep happening  it seems like the doll is alive
nothing much	same
wasnt he also an assistant coach at ncsu	yes he coached with norm sloan for a while
the harry potter theme song for example	oh that one is great with the bells it sounds so mysterious and magical
okay final question whos your favorite musical artist	i like carrey underwood the best
interesting ive heard of gordon lightfoot but i dont know that song i dont think	its incredible its about the crew of this ship in lake superior that died after a terrible storm
thats what i thought	what kind of song name is 21 m♢♢n water its all so extra
john wayne played marshall rooster cogburn	yes mattie rose was played by kim darby
do you know which character i feel was underused in fate of the furious	which character
eh its whatever the doplhins suck but its just going to be cool to expierence an nfl game overseas	hopefully beers dont cost 9 like they do in the superdome
which one	i still like the first one
i honestly feel like eminem is a walking symbol of drama	why do you say that
i have to work on dribbling too	is that where you bounce the bal over and over
well why do you not like movies	because they are sort of rote
man we slost some good musicians in our lifetime	i know right
whats the one thing you remember the most about the first installment of star wars	the death star always remember when obiwan kenobi said thats no moon
really im not sure i think i would like both of them or any types of jazz	well to start off you may want to listen to some classics like miles davis
yeah i just saw them	arent they old
so which is worse hater	episode i for sure two has awful dialogue but one has no actual use
nicolas cage movies in general have taken a turn for the unintentionally funny lately	yeah he hams it up big time in a lot of his recent films in a bad way but for me its a good thing
why is that ive always found him to be a bit bland	i just really like the way he looks he looks like such a cool character is all
how do you feel sorry for her she tried to steal ariels voice	well she didnt think her voice was good enough
and any way these russian mobsters mess with him and they soon find out hes the wrong guy to mess with	that sounds good i think i will see it but dont tell me any more
right i think my favorite part about them though is how different their voices are	true they wrote good songs for both singers too
definitely	what else
have you read any of the expanded universe novels	i have i was really upset when they made all the old novels part of the expanded universe instead of cannon
i think that gaston and lefou are pretty funny too even if gaston is a little scary	belle definitely didnt belong with someone as bad as gaston even if he was entertaining
i dont know anything about classical music but i started dating a girl whos really into it	are you going to try to learn something about it
it got really good reviews too i know mandy moore is in it	do you know who else is in it
is that the movie based on the game	yes that one anyway saw it when i was a teenager and seem to remember enjoying it watched it with my wife a few months ago and we both hated it
yeah and thats one of the reasons i listened to them	i agree i wish they would go back to that song
he did tarnish him self	he was good
i think gal gadot really embodies the essence of wonder woman	the part near the end when they go to the ball she felt like a superhero
who do you think will win this year	well the patriots are always good same with seatlle denver green bay
sammy hagar was no slouch though  they arguably had better commercial success with him	they sold some records no doubt but roth will always be the king
its a sad movie too though its one of the rare movies that drives me to tears	me too no matter how many times i see it i still cry at the scene of mufasas death
i know i can relate to it	same here
that is true but the cultural part of it is interesting	oh for sure i think disney is doing a good job on touching different perspectives
but i want them real	very unlikely man
yes thats the one	i never saw it i heard it was pretty gruesome at the end
do you remember any cool lines from his verses	you have to know before i tell you that its not his best work
i know right	i was looking at it yesterday  she also has karaoke versions of all her songs
no one cares about that anymore	it is all about the money but some guys want to win
i agree his receiving is what separates him as a player he should use it	yea i mean the blocking is good for russell wilson but he can do so much more to help out
probably true which motown artist is your favorite	cant say there is just one but i love the supremes
sure that could be an example though there could be others	i dont really look at music that way i think if a song is good its good no matter what
it was probably accurate on a deers life	i would not want to be a deer that is being hunted
so have you chosen a song for your wedding dance yet	no im still undecided i was thinking chasing cars by snow patrol but i dont think that will work
of course it does	no it doesnt it devalues the musician because now people know theyll play for free and wont pay them either
i admit its selfish	he will always be the greatest euro player
i know theres a music festival downtown this weekend and i was thinking of going	oh yeah i wish i could im sure tickets are sold out though
he thought it was pistachio ice cream	did you know that blonde actor i forget his name did lightning mcqueens name
what team do you like best	i like the steelers a lot
the album she has is called the first time she has quite a few of her popular hit singles on that album	i will check it out does she have multiple hits
hey did you watch the playoffs	yeah man they were so good
what stations can i watch games on	they play lots of games on the local channels and you can watch some online
maybe people are inspired by duck dynasty	ha  i doubt it
i didnt even know that was her song	it is do you like her music
yeah  darth vader would die and luke would put on his helmet	that would have been straight nasty
yes i do whats your favorite team	i like the arizona cardinals
i agree  its like people know every word when they are fans	yes i have met project pat fans from all over
who do the bills play the first week of the season	they play the jets
they definitely have been collecting some good young talent	it helps that theyve got murray running behind them
he harry how was your day	oyeah today was ok just got back in from workyou
does the piano player make it	well if you must knowyes he does
i like to watch it on tv	yeah with all the camera angles you get a lot of detail
yes it was one of the best	oh really
the story is great	i like how is in the cave making the prototype
in 2011 he did party in the cia	what was that a parody of
woah that sounds awesome	yeah theres also a bunch of crazy things that occurred behind the scenes of the movie as well
if they could make the movie more perfect it would be to extend the total time of the film 30 more minutes and follow moss around more	i agree the most suspenseful part was following moss around while hes being chased throughout texas
which was that	it was a 2012 packersseahawks game played with the replacement refs
i think gotg 2 may be the best marvel movie they ever made	better than the winter soldier
well it basically just focuses on dory from finding nemo and how she is trying to locate her parents	that sounds interesting it is on my todo list
oh i did not know that	yeah it should be really interesting to see how the trilogy ends the movie is called ix
that is so far away	i know i hope it is worth the wait
i know i didnt blame the girl for giving up at the end	i would have done it much sooner
mine either they even love the movies on the disney channel	the disney channel premiere ones
good talking to you	you too
he played a good riddler	well he has a background in comedy
oh yes  it was quite shocking  natalie portman and  mila kunis play in the black swan together	what is the movie about
manning done so much for this franchise i could not believe they would just let him go the way they did	i know what you mean i loved peyton myself and did not feel he was done right by the organization
ask them if not there are other movies out that you can see	ok will ask them when i get home
hehe  seriously though my theory is that both him and nagi are dead and stuck in some sort of purgatory  for the dellamorte hes probably there because he loved but killed that girl so she keeps showing up to torment him	hmm thats sounds interesting  like i said its been awhile since ive seen the movie so i cant really argue one way or another
yea	you know its tough to stand out from the overcrowded music industry she made it out on her own i think thats a powerful message
it really surprised me that the entire team decided to go check out the new planet for colonization when they knew nothing of it	it didnt take long for the crew to start dying from infections from the aliens or being torn up and eaten by them
you should really watch parks and recreation its hilarious	ive never heard of that
well take john williams hell write a soundtrack for a film and itll forever only be used for that one film	right i cant imagine the jaws theme being used anywhere else and itll always be associated with that movie even if it is used elsewhere
yeah no one remembers her but we all remember linda blair	almost like the opposite of the movie where everyone remembers her as satan and not regan
see you soon	see you then
are you a country music fan	not really but i am open i guess it depends on if its old school or newschool
do you like michael jackson	his music of course
more or less that you wont gain a ton just by eating at mcdonalds	oh so he was telling the viewers it was their responsiblity to order responsibly
weird i liked their music a lot especially that song my friends over you	yeah that one was okay
i dont know the liner notes were in japanese cool album though	thats hysterical
that too make the batter not leave the box or its a strike	see now we are getting somewhere
most of kubricks films were he himself actually banned a clockwork orange	he banned it himself why
i just saw the new pirate of the caribbean movie	how was it
thats a great film	yeah especially since its a great christmas movie
even the front office said they were tired of it and that he needs to mature	he does or else he is going to end up being the next terrell owens and universally hated and ringless
yes murry and director ramis got upst with eac ther and did not talk	what happen
true  we will know more when the next movie comes out	its fun to speculate though
theres nothing to do in this town	lets go to a movie
me too	who do you like
who is your favorite band	the rolling stones
i agree obiwan says there is no such thing as luck and these guys are way too skilled to not be using some type of force powers	yes maybe not force sensitive like a jedi or sith but they get a little nudge from it
yea half time is good	also the commercials
yes thats the one	yeah i listen to it on the way home
i just think anderson is out of his mind	while i do agree for the most part fleury is just as able
are they similar to the books or is there a lot of deviation	theyre very similar the actors are great as well
tilda swinton and john c reilly  it came out a few years ago  i think its based on a book	why was it disturbing
thats the only one ive ever seen so i dont know if the other ones are crazy like that	did you know her husband has worked with lady gaga
i suppose it was when everyone stopped sampling as much and started using digital keyboards instead a lot of that west coast dr dre sound	so you werent a fan of tupac then
hey are you a fan of disney movies	no not really but i do like musicals
and they had to deal with a rain delayed game that can sometimes mess up your rhythm	absolutely i think mlb messed up though they should have called this game earlier
im thinking its going to be sad	thats what i was thinking
thats cornells voice but its not even his best work	what would you recommend
i guess i was expecting less of the how he got that way more about after	yeah i thought that a bit too but i didnt really know the characters backstory at all so i appreciated it
alright alright	whos yours then
are there any classic horror films that you really like	i love the original frankenstein
i bet it was nice having him play for your favorite team	it was
ya for sure  i mean look at imagine  one of the greatest songs ever and that was lennon	was that from a solo album or still with the beatles
and that choker	it completes the outfit entirely
yeah man shes good	it had on the edge of my seat
its interesting though to see the coaches of those three afc teams though because they all have a lot of experience	im just not sure that tomlinson or del rio have what it takes to out coach belichick
they spread the field and stretched it quite a bit last year i loved it when they aired it out tannehill is impressive when he has full control of the offense	theres more to being a good wide receiver than just speed you need to have really high field iq and i dont see any of the current wide receivers having that kind of game feel
thisisamericashow you loveit	how about neil diamonds america
hiss youve hissed your lasthiss	ha what a great line
noisy but beautiful sometimes a little strange especially with the guitar tunings	cool whats your favorite album
did you see that movie last fall about the beatles called 8 days a week	no i missed that one
maybe renfroe and margot for the padres but petco might dampen their stats in comparison to others	those are two other good choices nl has a lot of young talent this year
so they are afraid of firing him	no i think they just dont want to really win
ugh fine how do you know that	i was curious so i looked it up the other day
yeah he was kind of scary he was definitely a mean dog might have had rabies or something	you know who was in that movie but looks completely different today
let me guess you were in the c band	ouch good one but ouch
hey what are you up to tomorrow nigyt	not too much you want to do something
its sad that heath ledger died though	yea they could have kept making direct sequels with his character
hes like the guy next to you at the gas station but someone who can actually portray that person	so a very normal guy
true i that movie does always get my heart rate up	i know watching them as they are being chased throughout americas most historic landmarks gets me so nervous
well because it was when i was a kid and had a more simple animation and story	yeah but times evolve have you seen the new alien
me too blue jeans is a great song	i also thought video games and summertime sadness were great from her
its called swish swish  sounds familiar	oh my gosh does that have a reference with taylor swift
i would definitely not rush out there to find it if youre bored on a rainy sunday afternoon and its available on netflix give it a shot	well i like charlize in everything she does so if anything ill watch it for her performance
i like to last year went well for me	thats cool most people seem to lose
how so	the isolation and the post apocalyptic world
you stoked to see how the cowboys will do this year without romo	yeah i think prescott will be an amazing addition
i have seen them both i loved whiplash that would have been my top pick for best picture	mine as well so well acted and directed felt so real and engrossing
that was fast didnt the movie just come out a few months ago	i think it came out around christmas
pharell has been in the game for long though he has years of experience	wasnt he a judge at the voice competitions
their planet is at risk their whole republic is at risk and she puts a guy you couldnt trust to make a takeout order in charge of everything	and hes such a coward he just gave up and surrendered in the big battle against the droid army in phantom menace
maybe that just wasnt in the movie	i guess that would have taken a while although they seemed to spend a lot of time on their tree house
their next album is called how do you spell heaven and its out in august	thanks ill have to check it out
i had no idea but it was a great way to end the movie	i agree aladdin was a great story
do you believe that han solo shot first	when i saw a new hope before its remaster i think i remember that greedo shot first
yea supposedly lightning mcqueen is old news and hes struggling to keep up with the newer younger racers	sounds like a few people i know
it also stars keira knightly	i dont like her either
you could carry an extra offensive player	or defense
plus i love his new song	which one love yourself
i saw so many shows there and a lot of the big names like men at work legendary pink dots echo and the bunnymen nina hagen toad the wet sprocket and many others i cant remember	wow i dont think ive seen that many but i did have front row for flock of seagulls and managed to catch squeeze when i was on a trip to england
fun	yep exactly what i was about to say
im also in the process of collecting the led zeppelin albums	how far have you gotten along with the collection of led zeppelin albums
yes they always did their own singing they started playing instruments later	what was the show about
its always fun to see the rookies that surprise you	my dark horse for rookie of the year is derek barnett
not really its more of a comedy	oh is it the one with woody harrelson
its a pov action film about the charcter of henry	so what is going on
maybe i wont watch it then the first one wasnt that good	i didnt know they were planning on coming out with a new one
thats interesting for a take	i know but its a fact as well
hey that would be pretty cool  giraffes are huge	why stop there  maybe a trex
what romance movie did he do	he did one called the quiet one
yeah she has to be one of the worst with her stupid fur coat	shes a terrible person with even worse fashion sense
the comeback was amazing but i think the fact that it was the patriots left a sour taste in peoples mouths	americans like the underdog
do you think lebron will continue to improve and evolve his game	lebron is getting better every season  he is now getting better at this three point shooting making him a complete scorer
name a female singer who put her heart soul and guts into her music	well if you are talking old school that would be aretha franklin her version of aint no way is angelic
not necessariliy i just know that it costs a ton to go to the stadium to watch a game so you have to do something to make it worth the amount you have to pay	thats true i guess its not really something that the average family could afford  easier to just watch it on tv too
i just saw the what has to be the cutest pants ever	what are you babbling about jessica
maybe odd thomas its dark but funny	i liked that show did you see the one with the last anton yelchon charlie bartlet
it was called pageant material	ive heard of that when did it come out
well i just dont like extremely graphic language or sexual content would it be safe in those areas	yes there might have been a few mild curse words and maybe some language that was a bit sexual but nothing really bad
yes that was a great song	she is also an activist for foundations too
hes mine too i think hes so cute	i know i loved the opening of the movie when he was dancing around
i also think that was a great movie they really did justice for the original jurassic park movie	i know i felt really nostalgic while watching it and kept thinking about the original
thats awesome when was that purple rain days	no i was too young to see him then i saw him in 1998 at madison square garden
is that a cartoon movie	technically its computer animated
you know what song i used to hate and really like now	what
these early songs really targeted the teenage girl audience  i recall all the screaming and fainting when they sang	yes the first line of if i fell in love with you just seemed so personal and the women loved it
yeah but he would do the same thing	luke was out for weeks with a concussion and he didnt feel the need to jump back in
i think that was part of the magic	you are right  it really touched me
everything included all genres what do you like the most	if im counting horror movies i have to say the hills have eyes two that movie was just great
abu is a pain in the butt  its because of him the chamber closed and he didnt want to share with the street kids	i never thought of that  were the songs still as good
they dont want any of that	you aint right
the force is it a religion woth a power or do people who blieve in it so much get power	what do you mean
i loved the way they did that	made the movie have an edgy feel
why didnt you like it	where do i even start
have you ever seen fight club	of course thats a classic
yeah i didnt even understand the birthday scene with the mad hatter	oh you mean the unbirthday scene
hes a musician and he passed away in 2010   i think her last album was about his death very spooky sad songs	wow sounds kind of depressing
precisely	so whats the issue
do you think he and luke are a lot alike	yes  i just think luke was better at controlling his anger  it wouldnt surprise me if luke ended up going to the dark side at some point
yeah he and his family are taking care of the hotel during the winter season	i have heard that movie is very scary
music in movie trailers these days is awful	i know right so cliche
it is my favorite radiohead song	they are so mellow and can sometimes have really deep meanings to their songs
oh thats interesting	i saw they were moving back to la and wanted to give them a shot
honey bee is good	i have never heard that one what album is it on
cool cool	yes yes it is
thats when they took the lead it was over from there	true but the desperate shot isaiah thomas put up at the buzzer didnt look horribly off
i think so too  i still watch blue hawaii every christmas	i love blue hawaii  elvis is like bing its like singing is what i do its so easy
what year did the shining come out seems like it has been out forever	it was released for the first time on may 23rd 1980
i feel the same way  growing up my father was a giants fan and my grandfather was a jets fan so i always pull for both	do you remember the one year when they thought there would be a subway series between the 2 teams
that was another great film	some people theorize that both of those movies are in the same universe as each other along with a few other films of his
the guy who is holding her john said she was some sort of a killer it sounded like she killed a lot of people	okay so what made her great in the movie
huh he had 9 seasons with 1000 yards rushing	thats whole lotta running with da ball
yes that is the one my friends said it was scary	i actually saw it the other day i love how it ended
i agree it felt a tad bit over the top	no where near as good as the first john wick
i like cruz too but lightning mcqueen is still my favorite	the demolition derby scene was the best part of the movie
hey whats your favorite song on the billboard music charts right now	probably the song airplay by gainer
would you call that rock	yeah they are a little bit  a little bit soul too
i wonder how much they get	well they are paying for kershawetiherjensen
did you hear about the free concert this summer	no where
who else	not the patriots thats for sure raiders or broncos
you would think that since everyone has a youtube account now we would have a lot of pop stars	i think that people who get famous because of a viral video are short lived
i feel as if you are just disagreeing with me	nah it sucks
perhaps its the fact that they are just everywhere around these parts	probably because you dont have another football team in this market
man i love the way he played just did not care	yep and he was a funny dude
i think he was irritated by the genie but i think he hated aladdin	what makes you come to that conclusion
didnt they draft someone this year fairly year on	yeah they ended up with deshone kizer out of notre dame
did you see it yet	no i havent gotten to see it yet dont spoil it for me
i know i loved backstreet boys	wow thats hillarious
i think you are correct	hopefully the falcons will be good next year
what is the last movie you saw in the theater	oh it was that disney movie moana
i would think that is what makes him cooler than everyone	well he was voiced by james earl jones so thats another positive
is your son still playing baseball	yes he plays shortstop
i mean suicide squad was pretty good but batman v superman sucked	you know i liked it the first time i saw it  then i watched it on hbo and the more i watched it the worse it got
well journey is one of my favorite bands in that time but really it is just one of my favorite bands	absolutely they have some of the best music and they have many songs that topped the charts
yes it is done very well but you know how much i like tom cruise	oh that is very true i think hes a great actor
i dont know anything about the players anymore but i used to	why do you say that
did you like them before they moved to la	not really
mine too  i even learned to play the guitar so i could play along	i remember the night kurt cobain died  i was watching mtv and they had nonstop coverage
i hope we at least make it to the playoffs this year	yes you would like that wouldnt you
what bands	pearl jam and bush
i agree but its still fun to see classic stories brought to life in new ways	good point i think ill rent the new beauty and the beast this weekend
yeah interesting choice for aquaman	yeah but that character needed a little updating
i love that song	me too the video be making me trip people with walkmans and stuff from the early eighties
oh thats right the rock and roll hall of fame is there isnt it	it is they have inductions every year for new artists
yeah they were definitely do for some	they did an okay job on trout
gosh i hope not hes my favorite player	i am really hoping that my team will do well this year i say that every year and they dont but i wont give up hope
what happens in it	peter takes wendy and her family to neverland
what does steve smith of the ravens do after every game	oh i know this one he leaves his  cleats on the field to raise awareness about homeless people without shoes
jameis winston	yeah
really but what makes you watch the superbowl then	i love just watching the halftime show and the commercials
have you seen that movie sisters	no i dont think so who is in it
yes see hes so smart ive been listening to that song for years and still sometimes catch something new	okay cool so does he do concerts and stuff
i saw pet semetary	cool  who directed that
it was hard to tell since nebula was blue and all made up basically bald too its not your fault	i know but i felt kind of embarrassed being a big karen fan myself
now your talking he’s another one of my favorite superheroes the winter soldier was excellent	i agree the first one was just ok but the winter soldier and civil war were great
im joining the ap train	adrian peterson what has he done recently
november 301994	when and how did he die
they also have great cars	do you have a favorite out of all eight movies
that is crazy i cant get enough nfl facts i wonder what they did for half time	you know i dont remember but the the most famous nfl cheerleading squad is the dallas cowboy cheerleaders who was originally a malefemale group called the cowbelles  beaux
thats weird i wonder what other movies have subtle shared universes	i think the quentin tarantino movies take place in the same universe
i saw that movie once couldnt make heads or tails of it	its a concept album about war and about waters himself and how he felt like fame had turned him into a pseudofascist
they gave it seven out of ten stars i imagine with whate they grossed for the movie it really doesnt matter about critics	who starred in it
coraline its this stopaction movie thats based on a book by neil gaiman	it wasnt hard to understand
well who does not like going out	what do you have in mind for going out
you just do not hear voices like hers	shes truly a special soul
i really enjoyed it  they have brought back some of the original actors	orlando bloom and keira knightley
tell me about it i remembered when bambi first learned to speak it was so sweet seeing him try to say birdsbburr	thumper was such a good friend to him teaching him how to speak
its like harry gets to be the dad he always wished he had	its cool to see how ron and hermione are so proud of their kids ron is finally confident and hermione is probably famous and still hardworking
i know so what was clash of the titans rated	it was rated pg
that was a cool movie	he brings that coolness to every role and he brought it to the fast and the furious
yeah vegas just got a hockey team too so im not really sure what is so big about vegas the city doesnt impress me that much	i suppose it is good for the raiders because they will sell out every game with tourists from elsewhere but they do abandon one of the most blueblood fan bases and loyal fanbases too
whos your favorite nfl player	my favorite player hmm im not sure i have a favorite player
you should watch the trailer for it it looks so scary	is pennywise the clown in the trailer
i can see that  his life was incredible	from college football to vietnam
the lead character moana draws you into the movie with her charming attitude	the movie does not bore you for single minute
i want to see it again for sure	lets go together next time
who are they fans of now	they switched to the panthers when we moved
i promise that one wont disappoint you	i sure do hope so
hes definitely not tony gwynn at the plate	i would even take him being a serviceable hitter hes not even a major league quality hitter right now
i dont know we dont really know too much about football	youre right i dont even know the name of any players on the 49ers
me too my kids want to see it really bad too	did you like the movie home
natalie portman was super hot even in makeup	i agree with that
yeah but its a good pressure to see how well hed do in the nfl	they can always use a good quarterback in the nfl
yeah and the people are traveling together	to some kind of fun park in california right
yeah me too i could have used that the other day how about ascendio you could fly over a stadium or concert and watch from there	yeah that would be cool i could get in to that
whats the most played artist on their station	they play a lot of bruno mars taylor swift justin bieber
boy i really love aaron judge  every time he comes up to bat i hold my breath waiting to see if he hits a homer	i really like him  he is so aggressive at bat  they found another good one
what do rings prove eli manning has 2 and hes not even elite	the nfc east will be awesome this year
it had a great cast and is probably the best ensemble superhero movie in history	i agree with that they did well with such a large cast of characters and not losing the viewer with too many stories
how tall is chewbacca	hahno idea
yeah until this year he was oneanddone since 2011	i didnt know that but it doesnt surprise me they always fall in the playoffs early
its with edward norton and richard gear its actually a pretty good movie with a crazy twist ending	what is the movie about exactly
so whats happening in the star wars universe right now	well the original star wars story has already passed with the skywalkers and darth vader and the next generation is being followed
its got to be hard to harmonize 7 people	you would think
i forgot which group was he apart of	he was part of the rocafella team with jayz
i cried so hard when bambis mother got shot in that movie i was only seven and i have never forgot that moment	i know that seems like too sensitive for something in a kids movie
its a movie about all different types of movie that happened	oh that sounds really fun to watch
let me know if you do	i will
i remember disliking it too  it barely included the best parts of the book	i know  they even had john malkovich but underutilized him
i rewatched lilo and stitch today before i let the kids watch it  now i cant stop crying	oh my goodness  just hearing the name of the movie makes my eyes tear up
did you see bts at the billboard awards	i dont know them  are they the korean guys
silk sheets and diamonds all right	thats what i like
yeah kwhai leanard has been injured ever since he was stepped on in game 1	oh man thats not good  he  is there best player
oh yeah	well i was just thinking of him too because he was one of a bunch of artists in the 70s that used to get called the new dylan his first couple of albums were mostly just him and a guitar
so you think theyll make the playoffs	of course their offense is still one of the best in the nfl
really what happened	unbelievable fourth quarter comeback to beat atlanta in the super bowl
so do i	i dont think shes come out with more songs
haha yes thats what with of course a lowcut an matching heels	she looked like  a prisoner i think that was the goal
i love rediscovering old songs that way	yes the older playlists from like when we were teens are really great
octopuses garden	dude no way what thats your favorite song you have terrible taste
i know  they have been doing so well lately  it kind of derailed them	yeah they will bounce back tonight against the giants though
also gets you in the mood to let loose like you said	what about you when do you listen to the artist
that is true  but these days i still like old classics like zeppelin and twisted sister	well im going to go listen to some metallicas enter sandman now
yeah they really developed his character well	do you like r2d2 as well
hes not he passed away in 2001	ah i see what was his name i dont recall hearing much about princes dad
atlanta came pretty closing to beating them in the super bowl though	atlanta sure did blow it
oh yeah netflix has pretty good productions whos the main actor	yes theyve grown a lot in the past years the main actor is brad pit
true	i love mozzart the most
i know  it doesnt seem like her	not at all
i completely agree just better sooner than later	who are they playing
do you like action films	yes very much
yes but that is not the reason i like them	then why do you like them
why dont you like that character	jar jar binks is just really annoying
music so much fun	it really is i love to dance to a good beat
have you listened to that new metallica album yet	waitmetallica relseased a new album first time im hearing about this
i think they make the playoffs	i think they do too
yes true	thats what most like about it
ah i love lennon hes my favorite	he is great dont get me wrong but no one can touch pauls melodies
have you bought any of her albums	no but i have a couple of her songs dowloaded
it was great there is an amazing scene where she begins a fight alone	do not spoil it what about chris pines character
what about pitching	hes not a very good pitcher
okay and number five	no no no im naming songs that might be there im not saying theyre definitely top five
malfoy joins the death eaters and dumbledore dies at the end	yes its really an emotional roller coaster  theres humor passion terror and finally grief all rolled into one great movie
thats a little different it tries to emulate the sound but a lot of those songs have more of a cyberpunk or horror feel to them	it follows had a soundtrack like that very 80s sort of synth sounding but with a definite leaning towards unsettling it was a horror movie after all
its not like the rolling stones	yeah they were way cooler
i love rock band i can play on expert guitar	well arent you special
exactly  i liked the miniature town in the attic too	yeah that was cool  as a kid i always wanted one of those
do you like marvel movies	yeah of course i do
do you know if hes still making music	i have no idea i havent seen him around in a long time
so c major pentatoni scale is not a hemitonic scale	no its not a hemitonic scale it is an anhemitonic scale also known and ditonic scale
i did not know that	another neat fact near the end of the song they didnt have another verse to end the song with so axel is just literally saying where do we go now over and over again
i was ok with it but i can see it being long	also the ending was hilariously bad visually
why not	i just thought the movies were too long
i love zeke plus that cowboys offensive line is beast	plus their tackle collins will be back from injury
i saw her in that too she did not catch my attention as much but i remember she was good	she was but this was by far a more demanding movie what a fantastic role model for young girls she is so capable
why do you think that old ben kenobi let darth vader kill him like that in a new hope	you know i always assumed that it had to do with him becoming a force ghost but yoda and qui gon became ghosts and neither of them had to let someone kill them
boston is pretty okay	boston is a horror and the team reflects that
and the teacher did you have a jerk teacher like him	i had several but there was one that his part could have been written or exactly
you should watch it it terrifying	i read that it was not that scary
which one is that	god your mama and me
yeah whats wrong with the giants	eh i just dont like eli manning
thats hilarious i love it	how about we are the road crew by ace of spades
he was such an incredible artist	i know  i miss seeing him
ya then malfoys father was really the one to dislike hermione was a great character	i guess they had a big open casting call and emma watson went and won the part
it was miami and yes mattingly did	what was he pissed about
are you kidding me plantation states are packed with promise makers those are nearly the exact words from hail mary	oh sorry ive honestly never listened to tupac do any of the other songs borrow from traditional hip hop
any other special yankee games	yeah we got tickets to the 1977 world series the first one for the yankees that they won in 13 years
do you listen to xm at all	no i dont have that
how old is he	hes going to be 33 by next year most nba players start slowing down after 30
that is the thing i do not know	what are some songs you like
im bored of all of the music on my computer what should i listen to	have you ever heard of royal blood
bon scott or brian johnson whos your guy	has to be brian johnson his voice is the best
its called forgiveness  its beautifully poetic	that sounds nice
my favorite song is freeze	how long has he been around for
when paul mccartney played we could hear everything	next time i want to come over and listen
where is ariel from	under the sea
do you like the beatles	i do but im not a huge fan
pirates of the caribbean would be one they would like for sure	good then you can give them an option when we pick them up
wow cool and where is part 1 set	it takes place on a farm mostly
they were all pretty good  you might know she will be loved	oh yeah i remember that one too  i liked it
i really liked the snow ones in empire	oh yeah those ones were awesome
i know he isnt even a three point shooter	that shot with the game on the line is amazing the guy has ice water in his veins
im not a fan of that team i assume you arent either	nope i dont like them or the giants
what did you think of inside out	it was a brilliant movie
i havent watched many of his movies what do you recommend	all of them  but seriously encino man and blast from the past are great
what happened in the first star war	some guy died
i heard them quite often back then as well but have you seen the music of video of paparazzi	no i can only imagine it was wild
i believe the penguins do	who has a better headtohead record
i feel like thats a common response to that question  why dont you like them	i dont like them because of their known history of cheating
but they turned it around in the next movie	yeah only because luke finished his training
did you ever see phone booth	yes it was so suspenseful
it is on the red river blue album	i am unsure if i know what that one is
yes they are  but i also really like lady madonna and hey jude so there you go	its hard to pick a favorite really
oh hes great  i love that dirt on my boots song that he does	yeah thats another great one  seems like he sings about boots a lot
thats true what other movies do you like	i like tim burton films those are a lot of fun
they brought in ron howard to do reshoots and oversee the editing	he is pretty good i think he can do it didnt he work with george lucas
what do you like about it	the beat is really good and i love driving to it
thats interesting i never thought about it that way	yeah its not coincidence that dark side was released right afterwards and they really hit their stride
i like the titans	you from nashville
he and johnny depp have done many many films	he had such a strange take on alice in wonderland
what is your favorite type of music	i have been listening to rap and hip hop mostly
oh so it would be a good date movie with my girlfriend	im not sure about that does she like movies with suspense
sure no problem this saturday	fine
there were so many great films in the 90s	yeah there definitely were
that album did produce a lot of hits	i remember learning the line dance for night fever
its a tough situation	it will be interesting to see how it plays out
really how so	she is more of artist not so much a singer
i can make sure the machine has at least one option then	i dont really like to sing karaoke much though
madonna is from detroit right	yes i think so the home of motown
thats true i havent seen the new roster yet	i hope your panthers get far this year
and most of the past ones they sell	this is starting to sound excessive
well its not really a very original premise for a movie but it was just executed extremely well the writing directing acting etc just made it a great overall movie	yeah i know what you mean when something is really great its hard to pin down one reason why its that good
hi	hey
have you heard any of their other songs	im sure i have but none come to mind
i really miss the older disney movies	me too cinderella was one of my favorites when i was a kid
i can pay for you i have a new side venture and ive been making quite a bit of money selling stuff on ebay	what are you selling
what is your favorite comedy film	my favorite has always been billy madison
did you see that last minute shot at the buzzer	yeah that was awesome
it sounds really good and unique	did you notice he came out with a music video recently for i built a friend
no but i mean that this kid gets up on stage by himself just using a guitar and entertains crowds	honestly i think you are a bit to old for this
i think the dj was playing 90s music pretty late	he was i think he really liked that genre of music but so do i
hey whats your favorite newer disney movie	well i really liked the new jungle
i think they could win 12 games	its a possibility
i think no metal bands should ever have a backing track	of course they shouldnt no band should
i moved up here to new york	oh gotcha see you tonight
oh man i dont know about that tokyo drift had some pretty epic racing scenes too	ehh serisouly thats my least favorite fast  the furious movie
she has such a powerful voice  it gives me chills	did you know it debuted at number 76 on the billboard hot 100
i agree they all are so similar and the plotlines are so boring	they will just keep making them if people keep going to them
i think they have become much more experimental with rock and pop	i agree the entire ghost stories album is different from their more classic music in a good way
what musical group thats gone away or you never hear from anymore would you like to see make a come back	well theres a few but the one that really stands out would be en vogue
do it you dont have to do it full time but why not contribute to your genres culture and humanitys cultures	yeah and who knows maybe ill create my own genre or subgenre
whats your favorite movie	i would probably go with the last one
well last summer when i was watching it i was sitting really close to the tv and talking to my daughter and soninlaw i wasnt paying close attention and i looked over at the screen and suddenly the shark jumped up on the screen and i jumped back everyone had a good laugh at me	oh how funny i would have laughed too
yeah try to rent it on netflix or hulu before you go otherwise you will be lost	i also dont know if my kids are into it also
yeah they make them weapons from day one	yes and everyone is super fit
the little one werent they all little	uh no not your boy wahlberg he was a tough guy
i suppose so but can you guess what it was about	partying
i like that one too she performed it in the movie	i like that one too
im not sure i think theres more variety in music right now than there has been in a long time	agreed  the internet cuts out the record company middle man which helps explore creativity in music
but i never hear anything about these bands	that is because they never really got popular in the united states  but they are pretty popular everywhere else especially europe
i need to watch that movie again sometime soon	me as well
what happened then	voldemort was destroyed
okay what movie do you put in when youre in a bad mood and need a laugh	i think ive seen caddyshack about 100 times
yeah it was such a shift for will	i like seeing him in a comical yet serious role
lets pack and get going	this should be exciting
i was bored and couldnt find anything on netflix	haha i think weve all been there  whatd you watch
yeahdenzel was great	how long is the movie
who is your favorite male hiphop rnb singer	drake
yes they dance to the music	okay now that just sounds plain silly
her real name is aulii cravalho she has a amazing voice only 15 when she recorded	oh wow i heard her sing on dancing with the stars she was great
so you thought that nelly just changed his stage name to nellie furtado	yes thats exactly what i thought kind of like some other artists
i know it makes me feel old	i think i liked howie the best what about you
do you think the cowboys can win the super bowl this year	i think its more likely theyl win in a couple years
and rodney dangerfield and the big boat	oh and his outfits what a trip
what was the name of that song you played for me the other day	every rose has its thorn by poison i still cant believe youd never heard it
id have to say his beats and he made the west coast gfunk style popular	what is that
slide some of those starters into the pen	that would hamper the starting pitching though
when i worked in northern wisconsin i had a 1979 chevy malibu with an antenna built into the windshield	it came from the factory like that could you hear any strange stations with that
i like the one christina aguleria sung when mulan was looking in the water	the reflection song
who is your favorite group from that era	no question it would be the beatles
did you see them in the super bowl	yes
yes it is slow at times but super great in others it is worth a watch	ok thanks for telling me
luckily all the voice work was already completed	that is good but still sad that he died
i will check those out any others you would recommend	hard to kill was good so was out for justice they have lots of action
they have 3 solid albums a few that were prepopularity and one collaboration with touche amore	thats awesome whats your favorite album
i agree i dont want to hear these types of songs anymore	then why are you listening to it
i forgot about him  why is he your favorite	hes so cute and clever and loyal  i love his shape and attitude
what kind of music does lana del rey associated with	well shes mainly known for genres like indie pop and rock
not exactly they promoted the idea of a female character action figure which had always been lacking before	do you mean princess leia
wasnt maleficent based on a disney character	of course it was
that is even less likely	nah
i do actually ive seen the first one and dead mans chest	you would probably like this one then it was one of the biggest films of 2011
you mean the 1985 chicago bears	yep thats them
the warriors and the spurs	oh  no i didnt catch it  who won
at least no one is saying muse sounds like them anymore	no now muse sounds like queen
in home many games	i think the penguins win this series in 7 games
what he is not a rock guy	he was one of the first rock and roll
its coming out in november 2017	thats not too far away
did he do love songs	yes
its good for working out	yes its really upbeat and catchy
not really but they have had some classic stuff	do you like chicago
it makes you wonder what is so bad that they choose that	maybe the music industry is too much to deal with at times
snoop	yeah classic snoop is awesome
their discography is so vast	yeah trent has been at it forever now
this one had more feel the music was more mature	i still sing the songs in my head
his name is joe and he is played by anthony lapaglia	who else was in that movie
did you see any of the fashion at the met ball this year	yes i seen a lot of it it was less wild for the most part than last year
i well uh not yet	oh lord disney is really milking this huh
it is interesting	what do you mean
plus the performances were really wooden	definitely one to watch once and never return to
but better players do not always win the game so whats the point	ugh like i said its a guideline thats all it just feels better than betting blindly
i agree he should act like he has been there before	did you see what the pitcher said
it was the beetles	well thats not really different
i am one of her biggest fans	gotta keep calm their champ
the sec baseball tournament is the weekend after next	yeah i think florida will probably win it all
do you like him	his original stuff is actually okay but he butchered comin home and fever
oh so youre a star wars hater	no i definitely have a soft spot in my heart for star wars
of all the movies youve seen which one impacted you the most	hands down it was the village by  m night shyamalan the story line was incredible and the reveal at the ending was mindblowing
and then its played in the background at the end of the movie	pop music can be perfect like that sometimes
they were right i wouldve killed him off	but he did have a part to play and he became an ambassador later
no mate rich gang spit hot bars	to me rich gang does hip pop and not hiphoprap lets face it
did you know theyre making a toy story 4	i didnt i loved the first 3
i just watched fist fight it was pretty funny	thats the one with ice cube and charlie day as competing teachers right
adam adams jeremy renner and forest whitaker	hmmm still not ringing any bells
yea i like the clock that mrs weasley uses to keep track of everyone	and the spells she uses for the dishes to clean themselves
if you liked saving private ryan youll like hacksaw ridge	really  hmm  ill have to check that out
yea they have a strong passing game though and they are really good	yea big ben has always been a talent when he is on the field
yeah its not that bad of a band	how many albums do they have
which song is that	the title was lucky and it was so perfect
well if it does it wont be for like of trying	at least not as far as promotion goes
okayso what does it stand for	national football league
slipknot had one good album though	which album are you thinking of
dont knock hayden  hes done some good work  i just dont think he was ready for something like star wars  and i think lucass directing wasnt the best	lucas should have gotten spielberg to do it
i know that people into punk musics are well punks but what are people into glam music called	they are called new romantics its pretty similar to goth but its a bit happier
when and where was this	according to my memory this was around 5 years ago in reno nv
doubt it were looking pretty good this year	you say that every year whats different this time
i know this is an old one but snowden is really good	ive seen that is that with joseph gordonlevitt
did you find any of the  haute couture spring summer 2017  dior collection practical to wear for the average person	not it was just ridiculous clothing for rich people who have run out of things to do with their money
they are  a canadian based promotion that holds battle rap competitions	how does it work though
well they paid good money to carr to keep him for the future	yeah i think hes great and hopefully we can make the most of the remaining time they have in oakland
i just dont know what to think about the fast and the furious films now	i think i know what you mean but you need to elaborate some more
what part was your favorite	i would say the 2nd movie because that is when you hear about his back story
they are starting to bring back some of those too	i noticed i saw an old time mikey mouse clip last time i went to the theater
hello	hey you still coming
that is true	at least they did not go 0 and 16
this year a few months ago	is it any good
oh definitely he had a crazy season last year 1631 yards and 15 tds that is like beyond all star quality	im also going to be watching jordan howard
i just saw highlights from superbowl x	which one was that
wow is it that old	yes but it is a timeless classic
thats funny my mom sings the songs to the the little mermaid all the time	no way what songs
i liked the yellow submarine	and their records were incredible
do you like the beatles	yes i love them my favorite song is love me do
no i suppose not but i am glad he got over that	have you ever watched many in a row
there is this really cool horror movie from the 80s called ghost story that id think youd like	whats the plot
you are a minority	yes  i like mindless pop music
she is and so is edward just saying i find brad standing out the most here	well i argue for his seven performance that ending scene when he is with kevin spacey is remarkable
i did not know that was one of his	i think it was underrated it was a bit darker
i know but whay the lack of love for tom brady	im just burnt out over the new england dynasty
yes you are right  you cant match small on small with the warriors or try to shoot 3s with them	yes nobody can beat the warriors playing that way  well maybe except the cavaliers
he was such a good person off and on the field	yeah i love his commercials
i miss that defense	oh my god wilbur marshall was a beast
do you think rey will always be good	i sure hope so she has a lot of potential
yeah that was a great album	catchy melodies and production that was a perfect blend of where pop and dance were heading and where they had come from
did you like the movie rogue one	i like how its explained how the plans to the death star were obtained
me too who do you think the best running backs will be in the coming season	well you have to look at the guys who made the top 100 players ezekiel elliot is probably number one
robbie robertson is a good one too  he plays flute but has vocals as well	ill check him out  how did you learn about the native american flute
what is your favorite comedy movie	um its a toss up between black sheep and tommy boy
why do you think that is	i think rock has always been about rebellion and grunge was the last form of rebellion
honestly i dont like anything khaki	oh me either its so boring there are some interesting shapes though
yeah it was so good and so creative makes me want to see a live action movie	oh i would definitely see it if it existed ive just never thought about it
they are all good really	thats true
they need to take a page from mavels book	i know they hit a grand slam every time
id like that	try some bob marley
oh so its like a scifi action film then	yeah but whats cool about it is the whole thing is shown through a first person view kind of a like doom or quake
still he had a pretty big role in the movie	i think i should rewatch it to see him
yeah they got so many rappers know days its hard to choose	i stick a few that i like
the original was the best i never figured out who the killers were until the end	me too it never occured to me that there would be two killers
it is when music became more aggressive and it was all about a gangster lifestyle money drugs and cars so many rap songs just based on those	do you like the pharcyde such early 90s west coast rap
same here what is your favorite style within classical music	i adore classical guitarists
and there were novels	and there was a comic book
maybe you know my neice got married last month	yeah you told me all about it
the rangers beat them bad last year in their series	this is a different astros team  a better blend of young stars and seasoned veterans

shes better than jennifrr hudson	and miley
do you like the star wars movies	they are pretty epic
i like comedy and animated	animated movies are cute
maybe i will buy some of her albums	you should definitely do that
she did and it overflowed to her music	i really like that song though i hope she keeps making more songs like that
i know its a shame but i hope she does more movies	same she is one of my favorite actresses
yeah have you seen it	girl i saw that movie when it  first hit the theaters
michael bay turned it into explosions the movie	but they are cool
i agree  some artists have been stalked or even killed by their socalled fans	thats terrible  there is a lot of mental health problems these days
i really like her singing	all her solos in phantom are so beautiful
what movies did you see this weekend	i went to see cars 3
kind of  they are playing with the symphony orchestra	that should be interesting
well the broadway world and some talk shows and time i think i might be in love with it too	and thats bugging you because you dont want to follow the fad
i concur	i doubt though if eddie would have taken the role no matter the price tag
theyve got some good players like sherman but even hes having issues with the org	i know they were trying to trade him this offseason
wow that is by far my least favorite song of theirs	to each his own but i like it
yeah hes the fast and furious franchise he did central intelligence with kevin hart and so many others	now hes doing the baywatch remake with zach efron
did you see him in the 40 year old virgin so funny	yes that movie was great and so funny
anything i can read thatll tell me more of his story	its all in the lyrics check out his 3rd degree video the track gone as well

i love the song early days off that album	real good story about him and john growing up

what is your favorite horror movie	i would have to say the babadook
me too that is like what me and wife do on sundays is watch the games together	who is your favorite team
i am guessing he put on a great show	absolutelyhe sang for over a hour and a half and really entertained the audience
the hip hop artist	yep thats the one  surprising isnt it
i think he held up on his own	he sort of did
it is actually i listen to it everyday there	ill add it to my daily mix then
well it wasnt super recent but roar by katy perry sounds phenomenal	ill give it a listen again this time focusing on the production quality
yeah its from the 80s but it was really popular when we were kids	oh
yeah theres a bunch of good players that are stuck in aaa because of it	theyll just keep rotating guys up and down from the big club
what is your favorite animated film	i really liked tangled
my favorite of all time is the lion king	thats a great movie i love the music
well it was different than the original i can tell you that originally i wasnt happy they remade it	i never saw the original so i had nothing to compare it to
i like her she has catchy raps	i like her too and i have all her albums
yes it is a limited release dvd so you better hurry	i will grab my copy this weekend
and why do you say that	well think about recent music have there been really new melodies

whats your favorite song by her	just dance  i know its an oldie but its my favorite
same	how so
can you name me some	yes jewel
the slums of beverly hills is a good film	is that a new one
you like the new song	its not download worthy though

lets talk about the beatles	great topic
have you ever seen gone baby gone	i caught it on tv once but just part of it
handels water music its been my fave for years  i can pretty much whistle the whole album	it is pretty catchy and happy

i just saw lucy last night	i loved that movie  scarlett johansson was great
have you heard of her music	actually no i didnt even know about her until a cousin of mine mentioned her
with blake lively ive been meaning to see that	its great its just her and the shark for most of the film but she is intelligent resourceful and definitely not annoying
the smartest droid hes always keeping everyone out of trouble	nah hes just always whining
i agree and having a good quarterback tops everything	yea and theirs got his money so he should be ready to compete
thank you also i started listening to some steve roach on youtube i know ambient is supposed to be instrumental and slow but is there supposed to be more than this throughout i guess i was expecting more of a melody	its true that kind of music isnt really melodycentric but thats part of why it can be so interesting and evocative were so used to the idea of melody that we dont get to appreciate harmonies as much
yeah i listened to them a lot	same here
ahh we have different taste i think	what are yours
what are your thoughts	well all the teams that he has been on seem to have a terrible offensive line
i love fran tarkenton	i love cris carter

sofia boutella	never heard of her  whats she been in
he was pretty exceptional	i love when he climbs into the show window and gorges himself
it was very sad	i might get the cds
kiss the girl is a classic	it is lots of musicians like to cover it
that is the one with bill murray right	yes even in college it is known as a bit of a master piece
did you know he would eventually become darth vader	as a kid i liked anakin because i could relate to him as a kid i never realized he would become darth vader though
youre so right but that doesnt stop it from being hilarious	like the funniest zac efron is the man
hey have you seen the new ghost in the shell movie	i havent seen it yet have you seen it
i think the giants have a good chance at winning the superbowl this year	it looks like they have the best team out there
well beginning in the 1990s heavy metal has been growing more sophistocated	how so
i remember his first super bowl	when was that
i think it was interesting they went to the past for the sequel instead of the future	yeah but this prequel gave us such new information
i loved how it was very much still like the original animated film but a little more modern	and like every disney movie great music
what do you like the best about those	i guess i like that they are faster than regular zombies
i loved the music in blues brothers too	did you know that some of the actors in the movie are actually well known musicians
well she is the same way it felt like an evening spent chatting with the two of them and 10000 fans	what songs did he do

you seem to like nothing in hockey do you like anything	i like to cheer for the goalie since their job is the only job that truly counts
its where i first heard the weepies we would listen to pandora while we worked and they came into the mix	oh pandora is great so i bet stuff like ingrid michaelson and matt nathanson was in the mix
why not	there are those who feel its controversial and racial
i guess you have a point with that to a degree but i think about it in a different way	how do you see it
its hard to deny their talent but i am not a fan	understood that whole aaron hernandez fiasco left a bad taste in my mouth
i would say green death was pretty good	were they
me either they have been so good for so long	yea it is getting kind of ridiculous at this point
its a banger	i know isnt it

he is a consistent player	i also like jordan reed for washington
bb8 is the greatest star wars sidekick of all time	what are you talking about even the ewoks are better than bb8
have you heard of the song coco jambo by mr president	it sounds vaguely familiar is it an old song
how was that	it was not as good as i hoped
malicks badlands was about two young lovers who go on a crime spree	does terrence malick have trademarks in his movies as other directors do

i find a bunch of music i like on tv shows and movies	that is a great way to find new music as well
what does bitshifter sound like	they mainly do classic video game things but in an interesting way
why not	watching a movie
spooky bram stokers widow tried to have all the prints destroyed because fw murnau broke copyright laws by taking advantage of the dracula storyline for his version	im glad that prints were saved though its about a hundred years old and still has an eerily creepy ambiance about it
exactly i think their ownership structure really knows how to run a winner	cant really go wrong with either team
yeah it was a pretty wild night you should see them if theyre coming to a city near you	ill make a point to do that i wonder if the vibe will be different at his live shows now

i have done it for so long that it is not hard	cool maybe i will learn
i think if you know music you know love song	thats true but you know people
hmmm tough question  theyre all good for different reasons but im going to go with iron fist  i really liked the main character and the fishoutwater conflict	im going to say daredevil its gritty and vincent donofrio kills it as kingpin
if youre going to throw at someone just scare them i guess why put them on base	yeah what good does it do to put baserunners on for no reason i never understood that
word where are they	i dont know
you mean the kneeling down during the national anthem	yes it was disgraceful and so disrespectful that i just didnt watch

how could you not know youre movies crappy	well variety of reasons but often its not that the actors dont know its usually the higher ups  like in troll 2
i think ian mcshane	thats him hes a great actor
they are going to be a fun team to watch in the upcoming years	i definitely will be keeping an eye on them

have you heard the new nightwish cd	yeah i just got it
hard to argue with that	yeah buddy ryans system was built around his unique abilities
i dont know they always said that shatner had to wear lifts but i saw him in person myself and the guy is only two inches shy of six feet	so nimoy had to be at least six foot and a few inches thats one tall vulcan

whats your take on hayley mills movies	theyre kind of a gas arent they

mmm hmm so do you think he was a bad guy	to be sure he did go to the dark side he killed quite a bit
what game did rg3 hurt his knee against for cousins to start the next week	ravens haloti ngata hit him cousins came in that game and brought the team back to win against the ravens he started and won that next week against the browns

did you been to she  tasha cobbs in live	no i heard of her do she sing gospel  song
oh how much	216 million quite a contract
no the story was super original and fun	nice with something like pride and prejudice though i feel like id struggle
nope i went to classical high back in the day they changed that to central high that was back in 1986	did you play basketball
why would you think that	i mean they have a stable of other players that could carry the team while hes out
so why did they have rey and then leave her on jakku	because even after the fall of the empire they were in danger
yes hitchcock not her best work but still enjoyable	what else do you have of her
yes i just hope they dont ruin it	well the animated disney version will always exist they cant change that masterpiece
you like that more than the big lebowski	i do the big lebowski is a classic but burn after reading is smarter in my opinion

shes still on the scene i suppose she did the super bowl halftime show last year	was surprising there wasnt a controversy surrounding her during that show
he is good	i will have to look him up and look at his stats
chicago theyre great	what is the album called
oh that is too bad	the last one didnt seem as good
what i totally though scarlet johansans dress was perfect fit her perfectly	no way emmas beaded golden 20s style gown was amazing
they retired i didnt know that i thought they still go on tour	paul mccartney still does concerts but he does them as a solo act  yes they broke up years ago and retired the band
yes it is actually really well done	why do you say that
the catalyst for it was my trip to oakland i went to a jazz club	ah i remember you mentioning that trip
the one about letting go	oh you mean frozen
i thought tokyo drift had vin diesel may be briefly	actually it is the first movie in which they show jason statham
not to be a copycat but probabky the beatles as well	good choice
i wish they played them earlier	me too
how about those cavaliers	yeah theyve looked good but its really lebron and some other guys
i hope so too mannings have a lot of value	i agree great football family right there

i think pink martini is coming to play in town	do you want to go see them
who was the rich jerk in that movie the dude with the slicked back hair	james spader wasnt it
i loved how they basically ended the world because one of them didnt want to be sacrificed that was so selfish	it really was but its a movie after all cant expect everyone to have high morals
and keith richards too	he sorts of just hangs out anymore
it is really deep and you can feel his pain in the song	how old is token
who are you listening to right now	oh ive got an old luke bryan cd playing
hopefully they havent officially announced anything soon	oh really so there might not be a new album

jacksonville	thats horrible
i think the captain underpants movie comes out n june also	that should be awesome  i love that series
so who is your favorite rock band	im going to go oldschool and say acdc
damien chazelle  he also directed whiplash so he must really have a thing for music	i loved whiplash  i never have played in a band or anything but something about that movie kept me tense the entire time
that does have its merits	i hate over production though
enjoy the movie let me know how the kids like it	i will thanks
he began his career as a roadie and a backup dancer	when was he born
im a big suns fan so hopefully they draft someone good	im sure they will
i played the same never got to play college football	what position did you play
yeah but the movie keeps doing this funny thing where it brings in stars to explain stuff to us as we watch the movie	like its not part of the actual plot
when	ill listen to it the next time i think ill of her as a parent
i dont especially like thriller movies	oh really  why not
so you really wouldnt watch jurassic park	too scary i dont like to watch people get eaten
im not saying it wasnt farfetched but at least it was in the realm of plausible	face transplants can happen  i read an article about it
they have no quarterback	they have mccown
shes really hilarious	i think so too  i think she made the movie
yeah its been years since the last one 10000 days	that was a good album but not as good as lateralus i think
yeah i can see that	after getting out there to promote it so heavily it would be a shame if it just totally bombed
those two women from saturday night live that hosted the golden globes tiny fey and amy poehler	oh yeah i like them is the movie good
i was only eleven it came out in 1977	wow that is an oldie i saw one of the newer ones called the clone wars
mine are captain america and thor what about yours	i really want to see iron man he cracks me up
if you had to choose between being a jedi or part of the sith which would you choose	id be a jedi
that doesnt sound my usual speed	just take a listen
like who im bad with names	nick cage does a lot of their music abattoirs blues marths deam the boatmans call are all really cool kind of haunting
i dont see them working well i wonder how that ever happened	well they are both canadian so i am sure they had some common core beliefs or understanding
i had that one on vhs	i feel like i like it more because i never purchased it
oh at the new stadium	yeah its called the us bank stadium
for me it has to be a quarterback	its the most important position but i dont think it necessarily means the best player plays there
i really think some of disneys movies are poor	what ones
i hope i get a chance to see them tour sometime soon	as do i i would happily pay a lot of money to see them in person
but my dad is and i grew in a steelers house	fair enough
who is your favorite living new york rapper	i would have to say jayz
haha thats pretty dramatic	yea that was in fact the first time i seeing any pirates of carribean movie since then i was addicted to it
they were a creative choice it almost was like a greek chorus in drama back in the day	yes very much so did you know devito was in this film
reiff is a definite upgrade for the team	absolutely and they should be able to better protect their quarterback with a stronger line
i just miss how most of their songs were uplifting and had such meaning	they had a couple of strange ones too
which one was your favorite	the first one
yes and unfortunately mama cass cass elliot died in the 70s so a reunion was never possible	why does it feel like a lot of the really talented musicians from that era died too soon
exactly they still beat the spurs by a respectable 12 points	yep if the spurs do not win the next game their season is finished

i am thinking of using their song flying without wings in my wedding	really i do like that song what would you use it for
did the beatles have any top 10 albums	they has quite a few including abbey road sgt peppers lonely hearts club band and rubber soul
you should go see it	i heard that it wasnt that good
did you watch the lakers and the cavaliers wednesday	yeah my cable didnt get the bulls game so i watched that one
how was it	terrible
did you notice thor was in it	chris hemsworth yeah he was all right i liked martys character best
oh okay i dont know too much about that	its great
the superman movie has it all	exactly
but both of them are struggling a bit right now and other teams are surging	well yes they arent leading either of their perspective leagues but i think they are still frontrunners
im a fan of biggie smalls	oh i loved hypnotized when it first came out i even bought the cd
so they have hands and can hold things why are aliens always humanistic	thats where youre wrong they dont really have hands and they kind of spray the ink like an octopus to form sentences
i think that is why he went bad	why due to people fearing him
they let people come to some of them they let around 200 people in each one	have you ever been
its going to come down to trevor siemian if he steps up and improves the denver broncos will be dangerous next season	i think he will improve he looked good last season for his rookie year and i think hell only get better
ive heard a lot about those albums do you like them	yes they would be my favorite of bowies because they mix pop music electronic instrumentation ambient soundscapes and other cool things very creatively
thats not a bad idea any help with luck would be good	its going to take more than just luck for the browns to do good this year
i would love to play some quidditch	seems kind of dangerous
i agree i dont think any of the mens outfits were very interesting either	do you think highwater pants are appropriate for a tuxedo
im going to need some examples	in the beginning of the season you dont know if there is going to be a cnderella team who is just magically good
yes he and his wife wrote the script and he stars in the movie it is mostly about their relationship	are both of them immigrants to the us
have you heard of the grey album	no im pretty sure its not by the beatles though
yea he actually was escobars main guy in the us	oh wow thats a crazy lifestyle
the first game was freezing but we were prepared we wore feet warmers and heavy gear	good thinking i would love to go to a game
i like the third one best myself	the third one is fine but i feel like its a bit undercooked
yeah but what were they worth knowing everyone was juicing	i think people can forget about that
it was okay i guess not what i was expecting for sure	it would have been fun to see boba in revenge of the sith to give more backstory and develop the character
i hope so what is it about	a guy who gets rejected to a school and then he tries his best to get in with jack blacks help
we need crosby and malkin to really step up to win	maybe he can score a hat trick like back in january should be a good series
i wonder if any good aliens movie are coming out this summer	yes there is a new version of the movie  aliens is coming out this year i like all the alien movies
i wonder what they will do with carrie fisher in episode ix	perhaps they will give her an honorable death at the beginning of the movie

yeah youre right	do you have one
what other bands do you listen to	radiohead the smithsomd
do you know who wrote it	justin didnt write it

how did you like rogue 1	it was cool
me too	what do you like
i hope this one is as good as the last one	is danny boyle directing it
good actor too did you see eight mile	i did i was superimpressed with his performance the passion of it
vladimir sobotka scored in regulation for the st louis blues giving them a 10 lead in their bestofseven series against minnesota	what was crazy was the blues were less than a minute from winning in regulation but wild left winger zach parises goal with 227 seconds left
yes i like that one too i like the beast	i almost forgot about alladin
that is such a lame and simple reason	but it is my reason man
yes it is quite exciting and dramatic	ok i look forward to it
what about demi moore	she also wore black with a long skirt

well its only sixteen times a year	that pittsburg game was fantastic
only some of them	yeah  i mean thats how it is with musicals for me i like some of the songs but not all
its got to be an expensive concert to go toit was super expensive	i bet im not sure i like them that much
do you like cars	yes i loved the first one
i really like their rendition of lord i lift your name on high and true of you	true of you sounded a bit dark to me

i cant wait until the nfl comes back	it should be a great year with teams having so much talent

there is a song on the radio called tshirt that has a cool beat	yeah i think the group name migos made that song
for sure	are documentaries okay
harrison ford makes movies and you know it	yeah but does he make good movies
yes and has so many good movies	another movie of his i like is as good as it gets
because she wears fruit covered outfits they even had a special fruit and album deal in china	fruit and album what kind of deal was that

i agree it was a hit	it brought them a modicum of radio success too
we should have a classic move night watch casablanca and african queen	what other movie should we add

i still cant believe cedric died though	me either hufflepuff doesnt get much attention
i am great thinking of going out	what did you want to do
well it was a local house show i wasnt playing that night but i had a tendency to bring my acoustic just in case because thered been times where id been added to the bill at the last minute to stretch a show out in any case she came without a guitar so i offered up mine for her to play since i wasnt going to be using it	very cool
the 49ers got 141 rushing yards as a team	oh thats more than i thought they would get
they are always a run for the money	they are so competitive against one another
do you have a favorite album from him	yes i liked his album titled giant steps
have you seen super bass by nicki	yes minaj has a good video
do they do any new music from their latest album	yes they usually finish out the tour with tea and theater from endless wire
i think it is it still looks visually pleasing and the story is decent	but just dont go in thinking its going to be like the original
he had his flaws but the best on the list	maybe carson wentz will be on the list someday
no he is just as bad	i agree they were all freaky
not really a bunch of little men living in the woods like that give me the willies	youre something else my friend
yeah the songs were so catchy	yeah we should get the kids together to have a movie marathon
that is what i have heard i have just never sat down to watch it	you are missing out it is such a classic
his music is still good all these years later	yea he definitely left his mark on music
my personal favorites are la catedral by agustin barrios and asturias by albeniz	that sounds spanish is it flamenco music

i also like sufjan stevens	whats he like
oh yes i did hear about that	it was not true he did not blow up his fingers

how do you miss that field goal	you kick it wide
you know what i mean is there anything good out	i think a cure for wellness might be out but im not sure
yeah just check their channel	their youtube channel
he may have been but why is shooting that many threes when he didnt make a single one  i thought he should have been driving and slashing more to create open shots for his teammates	thats a good question  he does seem to get focused on his own scoring too much
i really want to visit disney world	but havent you been to disneyland a lot whats so different

probably johnny depps character in the pirates movie is pretty popular	they probably would like that its a movie about pirates stolen by online pirates
you are probably right	the record doesnt state a whole lot
well the soundtrack in the new one is awesome	im really more interested in the action scenes
i dont either  wouldnt it be amazing if it was the same two teams in the super bowl this year	it sure would  it would be unlikely though
yeah i really liked octopuss garden that he wrote with george	thats a great song just like yellow submarine which is a classic

what is edm	electronic dance music
i like the part when dan akroid gets slimed by the fat ghost in the hallway	i like that little funny guy who says he is the key master or the gatekeeper or whatever
compared to all of the other bet music awards shows what do you rate this years show	i would probably give them an 8 simply because music has changed tremendously and it evolving and they are still trying to figure it out
i dont think i can wait that long do you know of any other movies that are like indiana jones	you would probably like the tomb raider movies they star angelina jolie
yes and dont forget their great quarterback benjamin roethlisberger	big ben knows how to make much needed plays happen
easily rumors	i would love to see them in concert  do they still tour ive got the biggest crush on stevie nicks
with bluetooth	yes i love the favorites station it puts together for me
apparently its december 2018	isnt there also a justice league movie

yes i love how congruent the theme is	whats your favorite songs from that album
matthew broderick was the main character	he was a slacker
and one of the brothers from zz top	still bearded
thats exactly my problem but i like a lot of his music	i thought he was done being popular but then he came back in 2015 and released that song sorry and i knew that was going to be a big hit
the purge is set in a near future america where unemployment  and crime are at all time lows and the economy is very strong	okay sounds good but being this is a thriller im thinking theres a catch
never	everyone knows it
hi are you listening to lady gaga	yes i am listening to poker face
yes it looks like hes definitely more comfortable being an offensive coordinator vs the head coach	well hopefully he does well for the vikings
i was more into britney spears back then	in the 90s
oh she was perfect as bella	i think she is just an emotionless actress  i didnt want to see her anymore
i know they all have	they have some pretty young players right now dont they
not a bad job though	whos in it
its called creature comfort	ill have to write these down in my phone
well i like music that tells a story or expresses some kind of emotion i really like besides something vapid like falling in love	oh you dont like love songs

wasnt his parents killed when he was a baby	yes they were protecting him from voldemort
do you think luke will turn into a sith in the new star wars	i doubt it
right and they followed it up with starkiller base a planet that eats stars and blows up many planets	it does sound a little silly when you put it like that maybe in the next one have a solar system sized weapon powered by a black hole
haha so who is winning	the braves the are up by 4 and its the last inning
i would watch this movie again	in fact i have already made plans to see it again
but which one came first	none of them i mean there must be a common ancestor but all of the variant rulesets sprang up at around the same time in different isolated pockets
i like suspenseful horror films	i really dont enjoy those they make my anxiety pretty bad does that affect you
what team is that	the vikings they always get so close and then choke in the playoffs
it is fun to predict who will win	its always hard to tell

im not sure but definitely no more than five	yeah i cant imagine hell be playing in the league for much longer
have you seen moana yet	no not yet but i really want to im waiting for the dvd

roger he always had the jokes	i loved the way it ended
oh yeah they are awesome i like them too	yeah and dave grohl is awesome in the band
did you like it	yes i did
i think youre really missing the most important part here  a good movie can incorporate broad thematic elements organically in a story that engages the person watching it  if the person watching it is constantly being drawn out of the narrative because its posing ridiculous or unbelievable plot points the movie is already a failure	do you really think that  thats an incredibly high bar for any movie to get over  didnt you enjoy the lord of the rings  that was entirely fantasy and entirely unbelievable
christopher brian bridges	thats a long name
i would watch a second one	as long as the same people were in yet
you know what bugged me in the force awakens	is it something silly
i guess thats true but i think it casts a cloud on them	i think their championships are legitimate because they did win those on the field
well maybe we can go there together one time but i gotta run it was good talking to you bye	ya that would be nice see ya
i left wanting to go back and watch it again	well i know i will need to go see it then
i see my local one has a bar installed	thats not enough though
she will be performing at the mann music center in philadelphia later this summer	i think i might want to get some tickets to go see her i have never seen her live in concert before
she is probably my favorite too even though i love the character of snape as well	hes a very complex character for sure its interesting once you really get to learn a characters back story
i cant wait to look like julia roberts from pretty women in my spandex dress and thigh high boots and rock the eighties	i prefer to look like julia roberts from pretty women in the red flowing silk gown and show my eighties elagance
speaking of female empowerment what did you think about moana	it was phenomenal especially the music
good me too	i love the xmen
i wouldnt say so but some might parts a bit corny	a little of that is okay as long as it doesnt overwhelm me
yeah man that would be awesome	alright personally i really like future and drake
hi have you seen the star wars movies	you mean the new ones or the old ones
i was watching it at a friends home and it was the highlight of the night	now i can agree with you on that one aj green is one of the best wr of the nfl

yes	flat shoes are not good for your feet  i dont wear flat shoes
they all sound offkey and strange maybe like they were taking too many drugs but they have strangely great tunes too	haha awesome are they a good live act too

ah yes  rope  the masters most underrated movie	it was a little weird those two guys hiding the murdered corpse at a family dinner party
what is your favorite comedy of all time	definitely grown ups 2 with adam sandler chris rock and kevin james
yes but only if they have nostalgia for the oldies	i think i would if you are open to something a bit different
so from 1933 til now 2017	yes thats correct for about 85 years now
i cant wait to see it	me to i will watch every game
shes had such a long successful career she shouldnt have any regrets about retiring and taking it easy	i know a lot of musicians would love to have just half the time and success shes had
you like the movie tommy boy	i love it
very tricky i like how you think	i have had to deal with kids in the past myself
i think he also did a cameo in anchorman	yep meanwhile morgan freeman has been playing roles like god
are there any good movies coming up	the thorhulk movie must be coming sometime soon
oh no dont tell me that	they are good
well i guess the most important question is do super bowl wins matter	i dont think they do winning a super bowl is a team accomplishment many great qbs had to carry their teams
what is your favorite friday the 13th movie	i love the third one
oh ok so more actors will be in a single film	yes i just dont know when it comes out
yeah i think her name was kida	i always liked her hair
well next but i am sure how they all do impacts that	crazy
really  thats surprising	i just dont think he danced well enough  acting was fine dancing was just mediocre
happy is a song i will never get tired of no matter how many times i hear it i loved it the first time i heard it in 2003 i think	oh yeah and the 24 hr video he put out was brilliant marketing ploy it was so much fun to watch
they have a lot of rookies and young guys coming up from the minors	and always comes back to the goalie it seems
its like having a friend with really good taste make you a mixtape every week	god i remember those they were always fun
its seems like that one is very healing	i know what you mean its like the lyrics really say whats on your mind
yo you wanna go see a movie	sure what you want to go see
mine is c3po  so funny	okay well i have to say bb8
i agree i think that donald glover will do a good job as simba too	he was a great actor in atlanta i believe hell do this part justice

yeah i always thought tim burton had directed it but nope henry selick did	it does remind me of his artwork though
thats true i heard they did a lot to make it accurate	some of the characters even existed in real life

yeah  well he is sent to a orphan house   and the little kids tried to kill the baby	sounds sad
he was best known for the uptempo offense where he didnt worry about the clock but instead of wearing out the opposing team	i liked that it made the games kind of like a constant 2 minute drill with the no huddle
yeah me too thats one of her best ones	i think so too also blank space is really good
you think	yeah so dont worry run your heart out

nicolas cage	yes i really liked it
it is dangerous	i hope that my boys pick a different sport
it just seems like every classic disney movie has a really scary part that my son wont watch	yeah either someones parent dies like bambi or theres a really scary monster like in sleeping beauty
at least  the browns got some good draft picks because of it	no kidding they got the number 1 pick overall three firstround picks and five in the first three rounds
did they just build that stadium	not too long ago
if you like thrillers it is an nice niche of the genre to get into	what would you say is best to start with

i love that song it makes me want to get up and dance	i know me too i like a lot of her songs
it is next thursday at 800 pm	that blows i have to work

they do still make westerns the magnificent seven was a pretty big one that came out around last christmas	that sounds familiar who stars in that

anna chlumsky was her name she was great as vada	i think she is on veep and still acting
oh my god definitely when he saw all of the pictures of their marriage	up managed to be one of disney and pixars best films

thats not true  it was set in a different world that operated on a different set of physical rules than earth did but the conflicts that the characters engaged in were entirely believable  the heart of the story rang true	theres lots of people whod make the same argument about the second guardians of the galaxy fortunately for you im not one of them
that song always makes me think about the past	yeah me too those guys must have done a lot of drugs to make a music video like that

and the trex picking up the cars in the rain	oh rightclassic scene

where are the other yodas	maybe he outlived them all
we paid for it like 16 bucks	i see it worth it maybe
you could say that but i do not believe that	he was a child actor who made it so lets give him credit
how so	like the hole thing about time travel its just a gimmick
no not just that i just has a nice feel	okay how many songs are on it
is it your favorite team	it is indeed
yeah more traditional and has more straightforward folk without the psychedelicoriented material	how else are you torn on them
stephen curry is a star player	but he is too short
great music is impossible to not think about	that is for sure ill be humming this one all day now
hes kinda cute too	yes he is
how many movies have they made now	i dont know maybe like 8 furious 8 i think is what they were working on when paul walker died
i have never seen a truly scary movie	never
yes great movie	i read that book also
can you name the drummer that replaced pete best	ringo starr
what about a mix	they have some stations that concentrate strictly on top 40
did you hear about the new planet of the apes movie	theres another one didnt they already make one
i feel better this year	yeah we are going to go all the way again
its called damn	oh wow thats a pretty edgy name
well yeah but youve got to love that crazy 70s animation though	actually the drawings kinda creep me out
did you see the last fast and furious movie	is that the seventh one
cincinnati ohio its at a top outdoor venue called sawyer point and the festival is called paradise on the point	and its free no admission charge
yeah	remember after she ripped it sinbad made them bring her back out on stage
ohi see  sounds like more of an adult xmen movie	yes even though the only characters from xmen were professor x and wolverine logan
they are similar to u2 the killers fleetwood mac etc	i will have to check them out i like all those other bands
i guess thats true	who else made moves this offseason
who made day tripper	the vonastics in the 60s
man kerry king is just so generic	who
hi there	hello
zombies are dead people who come back to life thats just stupid	didnt you expect the mummy to be about dead people
oh i love that album	me too
rolling stone magazine has consistently rated it as one of the top rock albums ever	i know a day in the life is one of the songs that always gets analyzed the chord at the end lasts for something like 2 minutes
game is almost over	last 5 minutes huh
shame what happened	what do you mean
i agree  nothing much happens in the movie	what was your favorite scene
a movie didnt you ever see it	i dont think so
he is funny	i hope he stays on the show
that one was so funny	i loved the everything is awesome song
oh that whole movie was hilarious i like anything with kevin hart in it	have you seen the secret life of pets hes doing the voice of the little white bunny
i just dont think it has the same type of suspense that horror films typically have  such as a friday the 13th movie or the blair witch project	i think it possesses the familiar subject matter of horror films  i believe it has some level of suspense coupled with strange supernatural monsters
do you think she would have stayed given different circumstances	i dont think so
well we are discussing the cavaliers right now but what about the warriors	well to be fair the warriors would probably have won last season if draymond green had not gotten suspended
sounds fun	it will be really
but there are 4 categories completionattepmts yardsattempts tdsattepmts and interceptionsattempts	yeas and each categoriy is mutiplied by a factor albeit each by different factors
i didnt even mind the rock	you dont like johnson
wasnt he a producer first	i think so
what is the first movie you ever watched	i barely remember going to see the original rocky at a drive in with my parents
the new movies right	the new ones the old ones they all have their own appeal
thats so neat tell me about that other film the life aquatic	yeah thats probably my favorite wes anderson movie bill murray plays steve zissou and they spend the whole film hunting down a jaguar shark
i have laughed at that part when ive been in the right mood	i think its so eerie when she talks in that possessed voice
no you are right they didnt	what about other one hit wonders
i guess its a little too late to change the names now though	yeah theyve been able to make it work i guess
if there is i bet he holds it	do you know any other rappers that are incredibly fast
i heard that it s a boring movie though	no i love animals and i love cats so the story is very fun
yesthey finally went into the hall of fame	well deserved
i like before he cheats  do you have favorite	i like the one about the church bells  not sure but it might be called church bells
in the beginning everyone was obsessed with death but the moon brought them all together and gave them life and love again	the moon connected them all i never even thought about that
do you think they will ever remake to catch a thief it has been a long time	that is an oldie isnt it who was in that one
what are some of your favorites	i like several but probably amityville horror and stephen kings it
both sia and amy lee have great music	i think i like amy lees music more
yes well i guess his ear was influenced by church hymns too	i see im not sure i picked up on that
i guess danny would watch that	oh no i gave me little summary of all the suggested movies storyline and he loved  logan and believes his date would also
i think they need to draft one regardless next year	i know me too
no i didnt know that what was his real name	his real name was orville burrell
i was shocked at how well cincinnati has played the past few games	thats why theyve been my team for years
are you ready for the start of the season	yes i am
no he was in these three mighty ducks movies then seemed to disappear	i think hes been in a few things but i guess he retired
that was just the kind of movie they wanted to make they didnt make it that way for financial reasons	it mustve made some sort of impression though i mean they even made video games of it like ten or fifteen years later
yeah i listen to them sometimes i was just listening guana yesterday when i was taking a shower	oh that was a funny song
i like bogart so maybe ill get another one of his	bogart was awesome but i dont know many of his movies
too bad shes like 40 years old now	wow you are way offbase
you got it  my dad took me to the game	why were you a colts fan  didnt you live in bills country
oh yes theyre really good live some improvisation	oh that sounds up my alley are they grungey
as claudius pure perfection of course	that man can do no wrong going to be a dark day in hollywood and much of the world when he passes
how much	i got 100 on a vegas line i get 150 if we win here we go im so excited
will the ravens make the playoffs this year	i doubt it  not sure joe flaco can carry them that far without a solid defense
i really havent liked any of the superman movies because superman is always so perfect that hes boring hes so powerful that the villain is never any real threat	i have to admit that i liked the batman movie that starred george clooney because it was just so silly
very entertaining time travel right	well its a little more than that it covers all kinds of technology
you know i dont think ive even heard of that group	will theyre mainly known for being a big part of the transformers movie soundtrack  the original cartoon movie from the 80s not the michael bay stuff
it has a total of four cds a bluray a dvd a book and some other collectible inserts	sounds awesome
what do you think about the hunger games movies	i love them i like jennifer lawrence is great
yup i heard some good ones	probably plageius
that song gets stuck in my head	i know its a great tune
you know my patriots have it this year right	yeah they looked good this offseason
okayhey this is really good	told ya
oh really what artists are your favorite	i really like arctic monkeys the fratellis and the strokes
you are still wearing the same closes you had on last sunday	its my football outfit
i do not think that you will be disappointed	i doubt i will i love music and this group seems to be really really talented
from the cowboys49ers game	no from the cowboys and pats game of course from the cowboys49ers game
what would have happened it one of his own players had gotten hurt	the braves would have really been sucking wind then
just how smooth and flowing and relaxed it is	i gotcha i find tupacs aural components relaxing whereas class az lyrical construction relaxes me
so you said that youre a fan of furious 7	yes i am i really liked that movie when i first watched it
yeah something like that or maybe some back concherto in e minor	yawn
i totally agree	legends debut album 2004s get lifted went platinum as well
i know me too i couldnt understand why the czar hated her family	yeah but it didnt even matter all that mattered to me was the love story
why is that	i like the quarterback
that barely even counts it was only set before the first film because of convenience	no matter the reason why it still a prequel and that proves that some are good
this year dumbass obviously if hes a rookie he started this year	im sorry i dont know too much about baseball im only really thinking about networking
do you like thriller movies	no whats that
i believe it was the patriots	of course one of biggest teams in the nfl
i do think they have taken some liberty in casting but all seem good to me	i would rather seen matthew mcconaughey as roland
you may have heard it it is truly special	what is so great about it
staying healthy is easily the most important aspect of the game	do you think teams will work the players less during training camp so as to preserve their bodies
really how come	the melody is nice and all but the lyrics just sound so whiny
well guess it didnt matter anyway did it	no but as usual it all works out in the end
me too john williams is one of my favorite movie composers	i think its more like i have certain musical pieces in each film that are my favorites
yes so you get a good taste of everything there is	right i like a few songs from today but really like older music too
nothing i am watching a movie	cool
the falcons had such a high power offense that season its a shame they couldnt take it all	yes they were putting up huge stats on offense it wasnt uncommon for multiple rbs to have hundred yard games with multiple touchdowns
well for me its simple both	both
the bulls organization seems really lost	i agree the dwayne wade signing was a bad decision
and i dont think teams see value in a bruising guy holding the ball	they did it for plenty of years
hes my favorite country singer favorite luke song	do i
cool who is the singer	karen carpenter
thats hard to say  i like the nebraska album which is almost 40 years old now but i also like  the rising which is about fifteen years old  those are probably my favorite albums but i like them all	its pretty unusual for someone to come on the scene as he did and stay popular for so long
yeah the song golden age is absolutely fantastic	oh i think i heard that before on a commercial
which do you like better the newer star trek movies or the older ones	i really like the older ones because they have good plots and they capture the chemistry of the original cast better
nope is that a mumblecore film	yeah its one of the most famous its by a director called joe swanberg hes widely credited as one of the originators of mumblecore
oh ok you like the early stuff i prefer the older stuff but the early music is fun sometimes	yeah the songs are cute and easy to listen to
i believe so	the bears did draft that trubisky guy from north carolina
i really loved keshas cover of  zedds true colors	i think it is the saddest thing ever makes me cry every time
i hope they remake it that way and make it tons better	i would pay 10 in a theater to see it for sure
you know she actually has a great voice too	who gwyneth paltrow i cant say ive ever heard her sing
luke made his choices	yes but they could have been prevented sooner
really	yeah it was really well publicized
basically not getting back with her ex every again	i can relate to that
what about somebody to love	yes one of the best songs ever made
those are two hall of fame players	they also had tory hold and issac bruce
why	baby groot
did you hear a perfect circle is touring again	no i thought they had broken up thats awesome
it’s what they overrate especially the delusion that a team who finished last year strongly is sure to pick up where they left off	generally right every team has different personnel year in year out have to judge the current personnel other teams will improve the biggest thing is adjustments
i plan on seeing it the night it comes out i am really excited	is spiderman your favorite super hero
i agree i would not go there	how about you
whats it like watching in virtual reality	well there are several different theaters you can choose from including a theater in space orbiting the earth and a drive in theater on a cliff so its pretty cool
whats wrong with that you love movies	yeah i know i love movies
have you ever been to any of his concerts	elton john  no
fine thanks	do you like baseball
to be honest i am tired of everyone talking about pittsburgh going back to the stanley cup	yeah me too  they are a good team but i dont think they are good enough to go back or to even win
the quaterback	yeah i think hes the worst player statistically speaking
he always is  hes a funny guy	yeah he actually is  you dont think of him as a comedian because of this size
yup i know a lot of people agree with you  probably in st louis san diego and oakland	there are particularly two incidents from the whole st louis to la move that still bother me
he does	i love kenny chesney
i have studies the genres of pop rock soul jazz opera	still think you are clueless
well theres tons of good songs on the album	ill take your word for it
which fast and furious movie was it that they found out lettie is alive	that was fast five fast and furious five
nope all pop	do you like her music
why did you put gang in quotes	well theyre the most inept and poorly funded looking gang ive ever seen  at one point the boss and his men are having dinner at this restaurant and you can see a bunch of dirty windows in the background
yes for me thats the most emotionally resonant of the movies	and also the darkest with such a brutal sad ending and cliffhanger
well i guess nothing in life is 100	nope
still giving up way too many points and brees probably only have 1 or 2 good years left	this is his last stand  they are not like the patriots who are stacked on d
thanks i love how they hold my hair in place	i have an orange one you may have
this is a serious hiker movie	i like hiking
i like that song because she plays the piano while she sings	yes i love that she is so talented at may different things
the one that i love is graceit sound so good	that sound very interesting may be i will get to see her in live soon
well wasnt that a business decision	yes it was and it left the city of st louis with the cost of a stadium
i also thought darth vader was scarier  the new ones seem to have too many bad guys that you dont focus just on the one	yes  he was pretty creepy  i thought he was particularly creepy when he took his mask off
this is something i would wear to go out ini havent decided what to pair it with though	if it were me i would just wear either black or white denim shorts
me too he is very talented	thatll be interesting to see how he plays young dumbledore
im looking to get into it but i dont know where to start there are so many genres	well you could always start with the big four of thrash they were my gateway into metal
me too he did a good job	i was not a big fan of the animation though
so okay variant rulesets so they really are all the same game just different groups of people chose to use slightly different rules for some reason	thats what ive been saying right its mostly a university thing you know
the special effects were incredible	yes i was on the edge of my seat throughout most of the movie
i bet sales of 2 jerseys are selling off the shelves right now	oh im sure theyre selling a ton of his jerseys right now
exactly	okay i can give them that
so what was the best concert youve ever been to	oh definitely the guns n roses concert  you
the lyrics almost seemed an after thought	yep you could just sing them without really taking in their meaning
only 2 are vocals three are guitars then one bass and one drums	wow still a lot of members metallica only has four
me too he was an amazing actor	i agree but i think willy wonka was his best movie
what did you think of kilo ren in the force awakens	i thought he was a little weak
yep  and he spent so many years digging the hole	and bringing the rock and dirt out into the courtyard
me too	shes wonderful
whos your favorite disney prince	prince eric
i do  i think he is one of the best ever for country music	he is pretty good i have to admit  do you have a favorite song
why do you say that	well back them it was shaq and kobe vs webber and bibby
i especially am convinced by christians crying the choked sobs were spot on	yeah i know right
good propaganda music more like	not really they sing like folk songs and stuff
hopefully they have some	im sure they will
i liked 1 better  theyre both good but the first one just felt more like a tarantino movie	django unchained was good but not one of his best  i think it was just to make a movie where he could say nigger over and over
sunday night football is at my house this week	ok that works for me
the bar is doing star wars trivia next week what do you think theyll ask about	did han shoot first
something great about it is that you dont even have to like musicals to enjoy it	thats good to hear im not really a big fan of musicals
yeah its just really different from his first two the lyrics also make no sense	they probably make sense to him somehow though
oh i heard about that the seahawks signed austin davis instead	thats so unfortunate for him
i think tom cruise plays in it with sofia boutella who plays the mummy	are you going to bring anyone along with us
i saw batman v superman in the movie and i wish that i had not paid to see it	i saw it at home and stopped part way through  it just wasnt very good
perhaps there could be a twist on the movie	like what
i try not to think about it which was your favorite film in the series	i always loved goblet of fire
have you seem the sword in the stone	oh yes i love that one to
i love the harry potter books but im not sure i want to watch the movies	i would recommend them
that is the best part	what did you think of paul walker
true but they also shook alot of things up	all of the artists went on to bigger and better things
what are some of your all time favorite disney movies	i have a lot i would say the toy story ones
cool	gotta question
that does make sense im still going to pretend that he fixed his wand first	whatever works for you
i know but we can still see them on the west coast and that is worth it	i really only hope they play songs from the ready for the floor era
he is really quick	and he gets a lot of screens set for him
this is going to be his year i can feel it with aj green healthy the running game strong and the defense as strong as ever theyre going to do it this year	i highly doubt it i think theyll have a good season like they always do but fall short again in the playoffs
it seems like since he has quit alexisonfire he seems to put out a new album every two years or so	yeah and its been two years  its time
i know across the universe is a beatles song was the movie filled with beatles songs	yes but not originals they were covered by the cast
and the fans of the bears werent a fan of the move either	hes going to have to have a hot start to win the fans over
that would be incredible	do you think that their will be some great rookies this year
really  why an hour early	the coach wants to talk to the parents
it really paved the way for so many comedies to come	john belushi is incredible in that film he was such an amazing actor
like where	well i thought that around the end it was too convenient how hensons character escaped being tied up
alot of people would agree with me	no he played a role in wedding crashers that only he could have played
unfortuanitely i do remember that one i cant believe they made him batman after his terrible performance in daredevil	well he probably has a really good agent
i like im gonna be somebody what is your favorite	i like trouble
our pitching staff is actually better by far which is another reason you should come with me	so they actually stand a chance to win
would dave grohl have been better served staying nirvana	i think the foo fighters are awesome
yes they should	what about the new ghostbusters did you like that one
what do the haters say	they dont like the plot jar jar binks or sometimes the cheesy effects
the lyrics are so much more hilarious	well i cant argue with you there
which songs from the movie where your favorite	strawberry fields hey jude all you need is love
what do you think about durants move to golden state	i think its one of the weakest moves i have ever seen
yes it is	the beat of the song is great too its so catchy
who do you think is the best qb in the nfl	hmmm  im going with brady because of that comeback
but something went wrong somehow she found out that one of the people she called had really done something bad	oh that sounds like i saw what you did
she had a lot of good videos on things	she has a good mind
no just your dream concert	i would say the beatles they are one of my favorite bands ever and feel it would have been something to see them in person live
i like the bills  you	i like the rams
his brother and mom and dad theyre all mean	no thats not his real family
yesthe huge no talking indian	he was a monster
jerry garcia was a pretty interesting fellow though	true
what is your favorite type of music	thats hard to answer i like all kinds
his brother stepped in for one of the movies	did you see that one
if we get a tight team we can get a championship next season	yes but the team management has to know what they are doing in order to get a tight team going
have you ever seen hear no evil see no evil	no but i think ive heard of it whats it about
yes but arent a lot of singers	yes but he has this old school feel to him that is good
tommy kirk and kevin corcoran from old yeller	cool  anyone else
they might want to stop an enemy	either way it was well written
theyre a rock group from canada with a male and female vocalist	oh thats cool i like bands with two vocalists
what	thats hilarious he smokes the guy
do you like brantley gilberts music	i have to say i havent heard of that name before
did you like it at all	i thought it was fairly good but it felt a little cliche
especially when we win	haha  you are totally right about that
have you ever seen them live	oh gosh yes 78 times
june 2nd	i need to get it
do you like eminem	yes he is a really good artist
its such a shame lennon was killed	yeah they had some really great music ahead of them
ring of fire was a good song	that is was
it had so many bangers	yeah like born this way and marry the night
i cant let these beatles albums go for cheap there classics	thats why i want them how much for two
no i didnt recognize any of them and dont even remember the middle of the movie	who was thrown out of the cadillac
is this the last stand for the cavaliers	why do you say that
i used to hate the fast and the furious movies but now i love them	really why
any good kids movies coming out this summer	there is a “capitan underpants” one if your kids like this kind of humor
no	elia kazan did that one it is very good
im following oyu	no other batman movie has done that so far
he can be legendary if he could only win more superbowls	yeah but favre only won 1 and hes still legendary
he was even in that geico insurance commercial recently	i know  he had a very short career due to injuries  he was a great running back
cant go wrong with that	unless you know
well you get use to it with time	captain sparrow is entertaining
yupthat will always make me worry about a guys professionalism and commitment after hes paid big money	yesleveon is the most important player on our offense aside from ben
avatar was phenomenal it got so many awards	yeah it is one of my favorites
do you think your team will get any new players	i really hope so the draft gave the team some fresh talent
i think she is a skywalker	i do to she has to be she had the force
yea i couldnt believe it at first when the news came out that a bong joon ho movie was going to be on netflix	isnt he the korean director of the host and snowpiercer
a lot of his stuff can be found on spotify	oh awesome ill look up some stuff
yes it won grammy award for best urban contemporary album	nice that is fantastic i know she has many nominations as well
i know they surprised us all didnt they	much like the raiders
it is its really unexpected and unusual	ill have to check it out
and also guitar	and also drums
sadly i think david survives and the other android that looked like him also died	david had a hand in his death as well
i remember when i lived in houston seeing tons of sports bars either having texans or raiders gear on the wall so it helped that i allready knew some names	well the owner mark davis definitely knows what he is doing with marketing the team outside of states
oh ok do they resign thomas	depends on the person they draft
when they were playing tupac songs	yeah that song is so cool
do you think it was realistic	i dont think intelligent aliens will ever visit us here
what did he sing	he sang some of his classics like positively 4th street and like a rolling stone
oh so thats why you like the first movie so much haha	yep and its crazy that obi wan was killed by darth vader
hi what are you listening to	i am listening to pnk old songs haha i love her so much
thats right anyway my dads been trying to teach me more about nfl football recently	really what kinds of things
have you seen the star wars prequels	yes i liked episode one a lot
why not	i dont like music that is in the the pop punk
the budget was 44 million	wow seems like it did great
the new crap has no limits on cussing	youre right too much cursing too much profanity just too much
well the music is psychedelic rock so it is very mellow and trippy at times with the guitar and melodies	thats cool though the beatles were like that too
are you going to be seeing the new stephen king movie	it
yeah that is the worst thing in my opinion	i think they call penalties a little too much
you like the first one better though	yeah mainly because it was the original  i also liked the atmosphere of the fifties
take your time it is hard	i would have to say deltron3030 will be in there
why dont more female fronted bands exist	tough question to be honest
fine  did you hear the song that just played	yep
agreed pretty rare for a movie to have multiple richlydrawn female characters these days	especially science fiction movies
it is hard to see the damage until many years after most of the time	guys have killed themselves because of brain damage
and everyone enjoyed it	they sure did  you should go if you get the chance
the costumes really blew me away	yeah belle looked so beautiful at the end
you need to cheer for a new team	i am not going to i am from cleveland
yes  he was also in the movie lion	what is that about
like from star wars	i am sure it does not actually exist
do you think baywatch is going to be good	no its a campy movie
which other song of rachel platten is popular	have you heard stand by you that song is pretty popular and i really like it
he is only doing one more album	he doesnt tour much either
the oscar for best picture	i thought so scorsese is a genious
book adaptations i dont mind as much	me either at least its only once removed from an original source
very good tune	swine was good too
so we still have about 10 more years of brady	i wouldnt be shocked if we did
who was the player who led the baa in scoring in the leagues very first season	joe fulks
i would fly everywhere on that thing  it wouldnt be just for quidditch	i think it would be uncomfortable
there are slightly different versions of it so i hear	oh yeah
true what was your favorite part	the farmhouse part where he was staying with the nice family
well you wanna go see some live music tonight	i might depends on a few things
i bet he is	that definitely wont hurt
ok cool hows next week	looks good to me lets go
yes but he always ends up helping to save the day	i think then deadpool is a super hero
who led purdue in assists	mathias had 7 assists for purdue
dont mention it i love the band	ok great thanks again
i also like her song sos	that song is so old
and then finally eminem is one of my favorite alltime rappers	me too white or black his lyrics and rap style or some of the best ever in the music industry
me too ghost and dirty dancing are two of my favorite 80s movies	yeah but roadhouse is kind of cheesy
oh thats right you have season tickets dont you	yup right above the 1st baseline
cubs stadium	you dont even know the mane
did you see the orioles game yesterday	yeah i thought my tv color was messed up because everything looked pink
i actually like the characters the best	whos your favorite character
because i am impartial to most	and
look they have like a zillion new draft picks  high one	they dont have a quarterback still
they made some good movies the one that sticks out the most to me is st elmos fire	st elmos fire was directed by joel schumacher hes the guy that directed flatliners
i agree their music is infinitely better played in an intimate setting	i think thats true for most bands i understand why well known bands play the bigger shows but the sound isnt nearly as good
i have not seen that yet	i recommend that
i cant believe there is only about a month and half before the nfl season begins	it is getting closer  training camps are soon
do you like oreos	yes i love them  do you like movies
it reminds me of that too i ended up knowing all of the songs	i bet your were singing during the whole show
so you like old school	no i liked haunted house too
which artist	obviously bob marley
but have you seen it	of course i have
splash didnt that have tom hanks in it	yes tom hanks and darryl hannah
do you like harry potter	yeah sure
and eating a lot of raw eggs probably played a part in it	boxing movies are really well done as far as movie genres go
thats fair maybe ill look up some of her singles on youtube	thats a good idea swish swish is the latest one i think
it is	thanks
is east coast better than west coast	yes but gansta rap is better
it was in la	they played the kansas city chiefs
have you watched the new power rangers movie	yes i watched it last night
no you dont	whatever
yes	have you seen inside out
do you think beyonce will make a new album next year with the new babies here	im not sure but she likes to make hits when no one is looking so who knows
thats not to say he doesnt have a heart but hes also ruthless	he apparently has killed women and children at least thats alluded to
battle of the silly superhero movies antman or guardians of the galaxy	i liked the action a lot more in guardians of the galaxy
yeah it is right there in the new releases section	sweet thanks for telling me about it
definitely go see it so we can talk more about the social commentary	i will try to see it this week
it should be a top rated movie preferably in top 250 of internet movie data base imdb	you can watch up it is one of the most touching movies i have ever seen
of course not i love the eagles	me too my favorite song is hotel california it really makes me want to sing along
yeah i saw him on the solo tour he sounds great	really he was really messing up he did some really weird stuff
wow i forgot about that song im going to go listen to that	okay glad to help have fun
go ahead its the scene where	this is it be quiet is it after this no wait this is too far go back
but i enjoy it	me too
youre right about that too what team do you think will have a good defense this season	the steelers of course but they always have a good defense
i do think that it takes away sometimes from kids using their own imaginations	really i think it adds
which ones were your favorite	alice in wonderland beauty and the beast and malificent which was suppose to be the snow white remake
so have you seen the movie the aristocats	oh yeah thats an awesome movie  i love the cats in that one
what is your favorite moneyrelated film	interesting question i would have to say the wolf of wall street
you know the opening song in the lion king	yeah i know it the one that everybody makes up the words to cause they dont speak the actual language
i like the song he did with drake	jumpman that song is so good
i do not i cant understand what they are saying when they scream	i cant either i also do not think much of deathmetal
you like the seahawks	cant stand them
yeah he was the older brother in the flashbacks	oh yeah i guess he was think that was one of his first roles
they had so many tough guys playing like jim brown who rushed for so many yards  he was amazing	i love the running backs like oj who was such a great player but so sadly fell and became criminal after his career was over
really  that is funny and cool got to love keith	ya keith yelled something and did the slow cut across the neck with his finger at the guy
if not get the dvd its also funny	i will i love his movies
i guess youre right	let them tears fall and move on with your life
this is exactly what im talking about there is depth to the story line it is not just about blowing things up and shooting people	i have to say however that i did not love la la land last year
how does he do that	by watching football film and knowing the patterns of specific players
want to come over	sure thing
what is your favorite of her songs	im a leo so i like appluase
thats unusual	bass is so undervalued in music and its one of my favorite things about music in general
ill get of work at noon can we meet then to download my laptop is broke	sure ill be over i might have a few i can give you also i have several beatles albums i dont use
he had one less touchdown with nine more interceptions	well you must be happy hes helping minnesota now
i love his body is a wonderland song	its so sweet
yeah theyve been around a long time but their songs are so classic hey jude is one of my favorites	i love the song yesterdaythats them right
it hit all the action movie cliches it was great	i guess i can see that but it wasnt good
josh norman was a great addition to your defense	i know i was so happy when we got him from carolina
what is your favorite star wars movie	id have to say the first one the one that surprised me so much and started it all
no your notyou just roll	very funny
hows it going	not bad yourself
i loved jaq and gus	the mice  they were great
i think we lose 12 games this year	i hope not
yeah she sung from her own personal experiences	yeah i just feel that  her songs are for hopeless romantics
i will forever be a fan of music i would go nuts without it	as would i it is a huge part of my everyday life
so how was fate of the furious	it was so and so nothing good nor bad
cool how though	his tone of voice his facial expressions his fashion his overall demeanor it all just screams cool guy to me
did you see hes getting ted hutt to produce his second solo album	whoa i did not see that thats awesome news
landing it perfectly from 60 yards back too	thats definitely not something you would have seen some years ago
its not a teen movie	then what is it
the title is shades of blue	cool i love her music and i am sure i will like her tv show when i watch it too
yeah alexi amarista had a phenomenal game last night	yeah he hit a 3 run homer last night
yea it has been that long	well maybe this year it will be the colts versus the seahawks this year
this sounds a little juvenile	well it is thats the charm of it stallones character acts like you and me expressing his horror at the changes in society which have made people so pliable and innocent that they dont even have real sex anymore
right it has to do with human transformation and transcendence	awesome themes i love movies with substance
so whats up are you glad its friday	im so glad im so ready for the weekend
some people didnt like the way it ended but i did	it was unexpected
but dont they themeselves owe a huge debt to kraftwerk	they do and they have also acknowledged the influence of giorgio moroder on their music
is that the one where she has to movie back to texas with her daughter	yes after she finds out that her husband was cheating on her
that and other factors playoff games and the super bowl are more expensive	ive always wanted to see a super bowl live
sure will	thanks i cant wait to watch it
do you plan to get season tickets for the chargers games	ive heard chargers season tickets are already sold out
true heres one for you ken the snake stabler	right on good pick
i am not a huge mark wahlberg fan but it looks okay	is optimus prime in it i heard he maybe wasnt
and hate the packers	of course thats practically genetic
ok i will narrow this down a bit then  who is your favorite james bond actor	you will think this is odd  roger moore
what pattern	you cry when you watch a movie that has a male father figure die and go away
do you like love yourself at least	yeah ill admit i really like that song its relatively new right
dak is good and so is zeke elliot those two are going to change the league for awhile	i agree i have my hopes on them this season
i love those high school 80s movies john hughes makes some great films	yeah i know i think my favorite one he did was sixteen candles
oh i loved it i particularly liked that they let the amazons be visibly old they were strong and sexy and fierce but they didnt try to hide any wrinkles	awesome i should check it out vote with my dollars as it were
i cried when it showed the flash back to her family	i was glad it ended on a high note though
you have a point i especially like when chuck norris shoots the radio after the one terrorist leaders offers to negotiate	that is fun and sos when the terrorist reinforcments charge the school only to turn right around when chuck triggers the explosive charges they rigged to it
i agree how can that even be considered music	i truly have no idea
was that for my name is sue or ring of fire	no it was folsom prison blues i cant remember the name of the other singer though
a good bit  i help coach and play umpire once in a while	thats awesome that you are involved with your kids in their games
no the song is about how she is escaping an abusive father but lives with an abusive boyfriend	why do you think its about that
i like these songs too	the videos of these songs are also very cool as well
thats a shame its so good	is it
i think that was bad coaching when they played the falcons	what you mean
yeah but some labels are cheaper and just as good document records is a nice euro label covering american roots music heavy on the black genres of blues and rock and also good for oldtime rural music from white america	i have almost everything from the hillbilly series myself i also like archeophone records based out of illinois in the states
how can you not put that in the hall	not only that but he had over 1000 catches and 15000 receiving yards
do you like kate hudson	i like some of her movies
there was one film people thought star wars copied but it was the opposite they had seen star wars and been influence by it but their film came out first making everyone think the opposite	a lot of art movies music painting seems to have been influenced by things before it
ha nice bur her french singing on joan of arc is great	totally i do like win butler too hes a great lead vocalist the combination of the two is perfect
yeah and that show	with cumberbatch
he was born in 1994	his middle name is drew
ello	hello
not in comedies	right
i can agree with you on that one they tried to make it more humorous and it did not really work	yeah even ian mcshane couldnt save that one
i remembered that thats why i thought of you	i appreciate that i definitely want to go
i really like no good i heard it in pound class thats what got me interested in them	where are they from
she is very unique very beautiful voice as well	is she american or a foreign artist
i know i didnt think that was possible just around the river bend is pretty amazing too	oh man now you make me wish i was in a canoe with meeko
have you seen entire fast and furious series	oh yes i just love that series
yes there was a tiny station in manistique michigan i think wrpp they came on at 4 am with a rooster crowing	what music did they play
it seems to about this incredible special agent that they are training to infiltrate terrorist cells and take people out	whats the twist
i just like how the actors take the rol and give them life	yeah i know captain jack sparrow is pretty cool
yeah maybe im a hypocrite	at least we both like mel gibson movies
that is an incredible accomplishment	yea not many teams can say that
wow thats a long time ago	i know but i love older movies
did disney make any sci fi films	i think tomorrowland counts good flick
whenever we have to leave her alone we  put the cable station on the reggae or soft rock station shes been good and has her favorite music	my guess is that she prefers the reggae station just like her doggie daddy
i always thought 2pac was better than biggie	youre crazy man biggie was an amazing rapper
so are you thinking of going dress shopping	yes
the pirates won 104 it was a great game	did bryce harper have any hits
how about agnes moorehead	rightbewitched mother on tv
me too	ill be watching
he was a nice surprise but i think elliot is the clearly superior talent	jordan howard had nothing going for him though the bears offense was basically just him
what about the song of hers called change of heart	i love that and its off of her true colors album
okay i will have to check out some of his music	i highly recommend that you do
i though that too it kept you in suspense	thats what a good thriller will do
i agree	good chatting with you
do you think nfl football is too violent	well hard contact is what appeals to many fansthats the game
he was is and forever will be the dark knight	but he was tired of loosing his voice playing the bat man
me too funny right  robin williams was on fire	he did a solid job
well when i listen to the fame monster maybe it will jog my memory thanks for the suggestions	you are welcome be sure to tell me what you think about the album
theyre not too long either i think each one is about an hour and a half	thats not too bad
i like those kind too but i really like the ones that are funny	me too  i like those better than my own kids
i think ive had enough michael bay talk for now	okay
thats the best one rutger hauer is great	yes i love when he wets the pennies and sticks them on the kids eyes
i guess i like their country stuff better what else you listening to	oh mostly old stuff in my car like arcade fire
i think he will do okay  he did get a great job though	he sure did  he got in the booth with jim nantz
did bruno mars ever do the halftime show for the superbowl	yeah he did a few years back
wow that is a very bold prediction	here is my other prediction brock osweiler will start at quarterback for the browns
yea i didnt care for the actor playing anakin darth vader in that one	yes and i like that they explained darth vaders back story in those prequels but it  wasnt a nearly as good as the original star wars trilogy
really that is suprising  i thought you would rather enjoy jazz than pop music	who are some of your favorite entertainers
i saw that one kurt sang it right	yeah it made me cry
bye the way we can catch a early movie and can go to the mall after	that sound even better we can do that
that was the perfect character for him he was really larger than life	i still have all the songs memorized
who are the bad guys in that one	steppenwolf is one of them
oh okay	you
that was an excellent job filming that	yes he is good i think et was over rated
well i know that she cowrote and directed ithaca	i have never heard of that movie when was it released
did you see how detailed the cgi was	yes it looked like it was really grand moff tarkin really there and a young leia
your welcome was the best	i even bought the soundtrack
do you think someone will sign him this season	i dont know maybe
ha thats funny are you aware of her support of lgbt rights	yes i actually saw her recently on rupauls drag race
it will be another year of building on what they are now establishing	this year  we may see many surprises in the nfl
did you know that bon jovi was gonna be called johnny electric	really i did not know that
are you james bond fan	yesi definitely am
i also really liked the musics they had in the movie	yea i think they are organizing a singalong pretty soon too
oh yeah we are excited to see that one planes was a disappointment though	i dont actually think we saw that one
interesting were there any other familiar faces in it besides the rock	well david hasselhoff and pamela anderson made cameos
i do too were just going to have to imagine colors while we do things	im thinking of rainbow
well its embarrassing to say but	tell me is it an old movie
and talk dirty to me	oh yeah that one is good too
me too i didnt care for a lot of their early stuff though	i agree some of it was sort of rough
i think were also searching for our origin story as a country what were our values how were we made	and the conflicts you see in the music are still happening in todays politics big government small government
i wonder if hes a lot of peoples favorite character	he probably is
maybe i will take my kids to see it as well they didnt seem too interested but ill drag them there with me since now i want to see it	do you take your kids to the movies often
he is definitely one of the better backs in the league	how about demarco murray
what do you find as best	well there are many options
jayz bruno mars ceelo green among others	wow im surprised they took home the prize that year
like what	district 9 great movie that felt fine on its own but i would love a sequel
favorite music brand	love rock and metal
the cd i am playing	yeah i dig it
hunger pf the pine	what other songs do you like
will snoop ever release another album	doubt it why does he need to
yes my daughter and i have seen them and she loves them	good taste taught to your daughter you have
hey is that michael jackson youre listening to	yes its billie jean
i always laugh out loud at that scene	besides the movie being funny its really wellwritten
what song is that	it is that song by skrillex
they do have a great crowd and arena	yeah that place is always rocking
that sounds so exciting what else are you playing	it is a mostly beetoven concert but were also going to perform a mendellssohn viola concerto at the end
yeah i am not sure anyone in the afc can challenge them	definitely not in the east the dolphins may win 910 games but the bills should only win 8 and the jets may win none
whats your favorite music	i like rock
yeah his voice is good but the song is not  just not for me i guess	have you heard liam paynes new song
okay know what bothers me about baseball	sigh youre always ranting about something with the game you pretend to love
it makes all of the movies make sense when you watch them in order	i think that is so true
why didnt you see them all	it got repetitious after a while
belle was the inventor this time and they made a point of her being educated	i missed the bookshop scene the ladder that moved in the original was my favorite
stubhub sent me last years playoff tickets	contact the stadium and see if they can verify that the ticket number is last years
hey whos your favorite beatle	wow thats hard to choose all four of them were extremely talented
thats a totally legitimate criticism of flacco but im talking about his potential for this season	lets put that issue aside for now you still havent addressed either antonio brown or leveon bell
first so he has others	a couple now but theyre just not as good he just really nailed it on this album
what was your first concert	i think it was raffi
i think it complemented the film very well	i like that williams created specific musical themes for different characters like leias theme and that goofy theme for the jawas
i guess i do	we can watch it later if you want
true he did do some horrible things but in the end he turned good	one good deed does not make up for a years of bad things
thats how it is but in the midst of it all cady ends up being one of the popular girls and turning on her new friends oh and cady had just moved there from africa and is considered pretty hot	no wonder she became popular it probably got to her head too
maybe we could go together  we should go to knuckleheads to see trampled under foot	i have never heard of them
was tom brady involved	yes that is why i mentioned it
there is the song how deep is your love by the bee gees and fool by chris rea	i like those songs they are classics
i love talking about the nfl whenever there is down time at work	so who did you say the best team ever was
she hears someone trying to break in	she gets arrested for false reporting
okay who led ucla in rebounding	leaf and welsh both had 7 rebounds a piece
i just thought it leaned on generic stuff	not really it was alright on its own
they play at latitude bestivals and reading and leads	wow any more
which sequel did gal gadots character die again	it was in fast and furious 6 pretty sad
do you think uncle owen and aunt beru know who obiwan kenobi was	probably i imagine they tried to hide it from luke so he wouldnt go to fight in the rebellion
never realized it had such great songs	my favorite is lovefool by the cardigans
wasnt john travolta in it too	yes hewas
did you ever see the matrix	of course i saw the matrix its one of the top movies of all time
narrow it down to two then	okay well my first would probably be alessa cara
no real big named actors but everyone in it did a good job	hmmm ill have to check it out
whats the best song by the i dont cares	my personal favorite off of their album in a song titled king of america its really a good song you should check it out
i just like want another lion king so bad	their was a sequel to the first though
who are some of your favorite actors	i like bruce lee and jet li
i can see that in you	but as a musician i love metal and dissonance
have you seen the movie white chicks	no i have not what is it about
when is the draft	june 22 2017
oh yea whats your favorite movie by him	id say forrest gump
who do you like that is kind of like billy joel	what do you mean    why not just listen to him
none of them would have been great without both actors though	i completely agree with that point
youll like ellen barkins character too  shes mysterious in it	youre making me want to see this a lot
does she have any new music coming out	im not sure i think she just had an album come out last year so probably not
do you like listening to the beatles	yes i do
yeah it showed how ruthless he was becoming	i would have done the same thing
i dont think many people know about them	what era are they from
yes i did	keith urban won a lot of awards
lets talk about nfl football	okay
yeah you can see where the league is headed no one has an advantage	the cavaliers could win on any court
do you remember the first album	yes the first album was appetite for destruction
sadly not much to the disappointment of their fans	thanks for recommending them to me i cant wait to listen to their music now
i think so i was just worried they might just cut osweiler before the season even begins	that wouldnt be very smart because he has good game experience and you never know with these young guys how they will do right out of college
yeah their influence crops up everywhere	im thinking of the strokes for sure but their influence is generally all over alternative rock
do you like music videos	not really how about you
that doesnt sound familiar at all  its a comedy though	yes well supposedly anyway  it really wasnt too funny
it was great just as good as the first two	i havent seen any of those yet
have you heard of alex g	i havent is he any good
yes have you never heard of any electronic rock music before	well i have heard of electronic music and rock music but electronic rock seems new
yeah you dont hear much about them hes really good though	he does have some impressive stats
okay i get it	so what was your experience like
oh yeah wendie malick i like her	i liked kronk the best though he cracked me up
you know its funny you ask me about that band  i think some of their early stuff is great they seem to have mellowed to a degree and its fine but to me theyve regressed a bit	i look it at sort of the opposite  i prefer their softer stuff some of the earlier stuff was a bit too loud for me
whos got the upper hand	the dodgers
that show was so funny and so clever	i loved the way they answered the question of what is the meaning of the universe
who is your favorite new orleans artist to see live	oh there are so many good ones
true at least there are tons of bands now though	yeah thats true
maybe have the series end and then have a movie afterwards	yeah i dont really like prequels but i feel like the walking dead needs one
i saw pocahontas on a plane ride yesterday	whatd you think
oh why do you think so	remember the feud he had with mgm pictures and both settle it out in court
he is funny i watched him in so many movies i cant remember them all	i know i like him also
yeah i dont see that happening	i really dont either their draft strategy was inconsistent to say the least
yup her newest album	that song is stripped and beautiful
teams like the colts or the giants or the patriots have just had such consistency in their franchise players	thats true they have had the chance to build the team around those guys
no i wouldnt put them in that category	it sounds like they might be good why are they called gojira
true that	all the whos were so happy
i am just sitting at home doing nothing much	well then do something
you know what is sad	what is sad
mine would be yellow submarine	i love that one too
i have always enjoyed ashton kutcher movies	i have a few of his movies actually
ive watched it a few times over the years	the tin man from the wizard of oz was in it too
yeah man cant believe they blew it again	seriously their bullpen is terrible
rest in peace biggie	rest in peacepours some 40 on the floor
that was really weird too i was surprised at how they began the story too they kind of jumped right in	oh you mean with the death of the main guys pregnant wife
same	you like music
im not sure before i was born	i think i might have seen it
twist	yeah but im not going to tell you because i dont want to ruin it
i sure hope he is well rested and ready to pitch	yes they sure can use some good starting pitching
music is awesome	i agree
what were they	well the most popular was probably burnin for you
have you ever seen 50 first dates	was that with adam sandler
im also rooting for the patriots this year	i think they win too much as it is
i listen to it from time to time	i enjoy it i love older country
so how long does it take	the truth is it can take many years
one day we will have you all	haha
thats amazing i thought he was beloved by all	i think his raps got weird an entire album of auto tune
yeah i love her blue dress and big bow	i do too
i would say that aptly describes what happened oh and he did not care about the prisoner and her constant babbling he did care about the sheriff though	was jackson a criminal in the movie
that was was really creepy too  what other movies do you like	i just saw patriots day  that was incredible
in oceans eleven two what unique ability does julia roberts character have	she looks just like julia roberts
i dont want to miss a thing is my favorite song by them	mine too it reminds me of the movie armageddon which i loved
really who is your favorite	mater larry the cable guy did an amazing job bringing him to life
what did you think of that last mel gibson movie	which one the mexican
yes i watched unbreakable again for the third time	yes ive seen that one but its been years
no i mean american football not soccer	oh well we call our game football in england not soccer
yes yes i do and im proud	go get it so happy for you
do you use netflix or other streaming services to watch movies online	i had amazon prime which included movies  i used to have netflix
yes youre right if the film makers are hoping to shine a light on this injustice they need to make the movie accessible to everyone	i agree maybe some good civilian will upload a version of the movie with their own subtitles what is the name of the film going to be
what ones	shaun of the dead
how about some people change	or anything but mine
why do you like them you cant even see them in their stadium	well if i live to be 200 years old maybe
i know right  shes one of the great talents of these days	yeah i feel the same way
lets talk about movies	great i love movies
i have all of his albums	lets listen to one
chris pine was a little goofy in his role	definitely not his usual role anna kendrick was precious
do you think the seahawks will make a run this year	they always find ways to win games
im also a big fan from girls just want to have fun to true colors great stuff	she always seemed to be more individual as a person than a lot of other pop artists
those movies are so good	i enjoy them the plot is great
when they rereleased a new hope they edited the greedo scene	how so
im game of your guys are	is there a game tonight
yes pete i am afflicted with your friendship	i love you too buddy  hey you want to listen to my computer
who played malcum x	i dont know honestly i think it was a pbs documentary
yeah i heard that too im not sure what is happening with that though	me either that would be pretty cool though
they all need something from one another	that all works out in the end
they could have covered more	i think it was to keep it to a certain time
we will see if they win any more championships	i can assure you they will man
ugh	want me to give you some suggestions
with some luck they will stay injury free and do what needs to be done	thats the key to most any teamstay injury free
how could you	yea i want to see her again
yeah thats right and then got destroyed by carolina	carolina beat them boys like they stole something
darn thats 40 something years after the nfl formed	yeah i think only a handful of teams have ever won
pooooor unfortunatee soulllsss in paaaaiin in neeed	yeah and the song from hercules that the chorus sings
gotta love princess leia	yeah gotta love princess leia
im the same way  but these guys are awesome in concert	really  how so
i always prefer the books	so do i actually
im sure they would the money that song would rake in would be amazing	speaking of rb artists what do you think of bruno mars new hits
what kind of movies do you watch	i like all kinds really
was it good	i enjoyed it have you not seen it
are you kidding theyre classics	i know i just never happened to watch them
i recommend that one also	ok i will check them out
i liked that aspect of it as well	did you cry at the end of les mis
jurassic park was epic i really dont think there will ever be another movie like that	it was the favorite movie for an entire generation of kids
they have just 3541 pass yardage with someone as accurate as mariota	he needs wrs and tes which is why theyre stacking up the receivers
yes it might not be appropriate for children	does it scare you as an adult
yeah i think the same thing	nice to see him finally get a deal though
yes you want to listen to them now	ok thank you for the recommendation
like a christian mccaffrey right	exactly or like a dion lewis
im talking about the newer one  i didnt know there was an original	oh my goodness yes  it was very popular
especially for her age she is lucky	yea bad blood is one of my favorites so is our song
do you like return of the jedi	yes i love the entire movie
pretty much it goes back a few years when shanahan and his father mike then the head coach had a falling out with snyder	well if im the 49ers i dont know that id want to overpay for cousins anyway
maybe trainspotting 2	its a little early to tell if it will be as big of a success as the first
what else do you listen to	i like dub step  it has some good beats
well then let me get some popcorn	ok this will be a perfect weekend
i could see something like that happening	yeah them or the titians are my best guess
why do you like gone with the wind	it is so dramatic and the acting is awesome

it will be at the theater near my house	cool i could meet you there want to get a meal before the movie
stronger enforcement of very egregious hits penalties	and what is that
i dont even rent movies anymore	me either

i like pop music	oh okay

not even giles she has a different watcher	shes always been my favorite superhero ill have to watch it just for that reason
i hope the eagles win	they sure have some great players
did you think back to the future 3 was necessary	i do think it was necessary and kind of wished they also made a back to the future 4
i think thats one of my all time dreams would be to go back in time and be able to see the beatles live	i agree completely
did you ever see finding nemo	years and years ago
well because they got a young team mostly and did well last season	that is true dak is a great quarterback for them
thats sad	its fine i studied at penn state and cincinnati so i follow the draft if they have someone going in
what kind of music is your favorite	i would have to say rock

you should next try portisthead they incorporate a lot of experimental work into their form of trip hop	wow that sounds really interesting i apologize for being so close minded about music
it really is	i really like dear future husband too
the arc of a diver lp was awesome i think he did pretty much everything on that  keyboards guitar percussion and even the background vocals	thats why hes my favorite
youre so right ill be at the midnight showing for each and every one of them	i believe you but ill be in bed sleeping
sean is great in everything but she may have stolen the movie in the jumpsuit laser scene	haha maybe true very memorable
did you like that in time movie	was that the one with justin timberlake
really you dont think tampa bay will have a good year	like i said i havent been following too closely but i think that miami has the stronger roster and a slightly easier schedule
it has everything	just because it has marijuana humor
that is a great part	did you like captain hook
how come you get to know taylor swift	it was from her ultra popular music video you belong with me
well you should watch some then	can i go with you next time
remember when we used to love boy bands back in high school	yes the nineties was the best decade ever for boy bands
really what do you like	eminem was always been my favorite
he did the film never shows someone elses hands he actually learned to play in three months	thats incredible i couldnt master anything in three months
a lot of people but number one on my list is keith urban	oh i love keith urban
big chill also uses a lot of old motown music right	yeah marvin gayes i heard it through the grapevine is used in the trailer
i cant watch ratatouille anymore	why not did you not like it
oh yes i forgot miami	and then i suppose new york has a couple teams
whose pop music song are you listening to	katy perrys firework
yeah they just need help in secondary	could be a weakness
do you have a favorite star wars film	i really enjoyed the clone wars
the cowboys big time	was that the start of the cowboys dominance

i think probably moana	eh im not such a fan of the newer 3d ones
i like the avalanche	oh really who do you like on that team

i hope they have lots of salsa song this dance	me too
i loved her in the notebook	me too the majority of women do
xavier id forgotten about him patrick stewarts so classy	rocking the wheelchair
yeah youre right so what kind of comedy movies do you like or do you like certain actors	what is a few actors that i like but mainly just comedy in general something to make me laugh
i agree with you	i love that movie it is so exciting
so why do you really believe they dont make alot of them anymore	i mean how much can you make of a gory genre of film
what do you think about lady gagas songs	i like her music  she has an original sound and strong voice
i know and fat bottomed girlswho else could get away with that it probably made people who had no interest in opera think twice	freddie mercurys voice was incredible i could only imagine what he could do today
cause why	i said so
yeah this couldnt be worse for the mets	i smell another loss coming to this team
but i have and find nothing especially in some areas	what areas
did you see pokemon 4	the one with celebi right
what recent movie do you like best	i loved the movie called monster trucks
