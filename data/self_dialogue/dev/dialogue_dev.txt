who is your favorite artist	kanye west is my favorite artist
they have their favorite spot	she is always so stylish

true i havent let mine see 2 yet but the reviews for 3 are great	ive seen that too
i think so too  finding dory was great	i hope they continue making really good sequels for disney movies sometimes kids movies have terrible sequels
i think they should just go play basketball  they thought making a 53 man roster was hard  try 15	makes me feel like they dont want to share with their teammates
yeah i love tiana shes my favorite disney leading lady	i love her dedication to fulfilling her dreams it really makes me want to pursue mine
because they are nowhere near as good as we remember	well yeah that is called nostalgia
which ones	the backstreet boys are on tour again

i imagine you love marvel movies the best	theyve been doing a great job the past ten years  iron man was such a good starter
im thinking falcons and cowboys in the nfc title game this year	wait what about green bay
oh that could be interesting i imagine the star was julia who played the average guy	your are right the star was julia the average guy in the movie was hugh grant
he had to be human first	then he saves the day
they really had a ton of hits back in the 90s	yeah i really liked 90s type of rock so i dont mind listening to them  they have a lighter sound than todays music
that must have been exciting	it was so exciting seeing all the action from the spaceships and lightsaber battles was awesome
me too	my kids made me go buy it
you cant go wrong with a pixar animation though	yes pixar disney movies have great messages in them
cant believe hes still playing though	wait didnt you hear hes coming back to green bay
what	not sure about that
thats not nice i think shes pretty talented actually	oh yeah how so
hey i just read an article in a magazine about a disney movie thats coming out	cool whats it called
not a fan of rap	nope never seen the beauty to it just dont like it
oh and he considered kill bill 1 and 2 as one single film so he can still make more movies after 10 if he makes prequels sequel etc	thats one weird dude you know that
i thought that is how i would be but i was totally involved with the movie from beginning to end	the actors in the movie really fit the roles they had in the movie i thought what did you think
no i dont think so i think hes under investigation for steriods	really this steriods thing in baseball is serious you think  the coaches knew what was going on
yeah	i like the patriots a lot too though

im trying to think of some songs that have to do with dogs	why
good you will enjoy it	it will pump me up
i liked the way the personalities of the characters came out in the music	the songs were amazing
how could they have possibly escaped and had it be believable	good point im not sure how you could have written that without seeming forced
now i really like the falcons receivers i think they can get back to the super bowl with those guys	they certainly have a great chance to do that  julio jones mohamed sanu and tyler gabriel are great receivers  plus they have devonta freeman and tevin coleman
are you going to any of the games in person	i plan to attend a couple cowboy games when they play away which puts them closer to us
over a billion dollars	wow that is a lot of money
yes and thats why youll see coaches perform hand signals that hopefully only their players know	ive seen catchers give signs with their fingers to the pitcher
yes me too	where shes trying to be like him
he is too big to be so easy to take down he could easily be the best if he fixes that	that and gets an actual quarterback who gives him the ball endlessly
yeah i like her music	i like her song work
yes amazing not as good as blazing saddles	blazing saddles in the all time best comedy second to it would be young frenkenstein
annie lennox has such a unique voice	you know who else has a unique voice
do you think tagliabue will get in	no idea  an argument can be made just to include every commissioner  probably not this year though
yeah so cassandra can get signed to a major label or whatever	and then you have the multiple endings
if you think about it the death star is like a flying jail i mean where are you going to go	i guess vader was the first imperial jail warden
what is it called	singstar
i think it could happen way quicker than we think	as long as it makes the game faster i think most fans are behind it
its has a lot of humorous comedic tones as you can imagine with the cast theres a lot of shoot outs	i like the cast a lot and think i will look for this tell me some more about it
i liked the ferrari in that one	yes that was one smooth ride
who is your favorite wide receiver currently in the league	my favorite would have to be odell beckham jr

cruella de vil gave me nightmares	she was very scary
yes it was a great movie	it had a lot of lessons in it
i wonder who is going to be the team to beat this year in the nfl	probably the patriots like always and their cheating ways
al paccino was great in it	i know  what ever happened to that guy
huh man i want the cowboys to win the superbowl so bad they havent been to one in years	last one was back in 1996 theyve won that
yeah and the day drew is no longer with the saints is the day is go into a very deep depression	i think this whole city will go into a deep depression
eh id work on that if i were you	maybe i should rewatch batman and robin   remember what real cheesy batman is like
because i do	thats not a reason

yeah i think it was called juke jam	yeah thats the one its really catchy for a slow song

dude dont even get me started on the force awakens	i know it was basically just parts of star wars and return of the jedi spliced together
dude what happened to the panthers last year	i dont know but man they were bad
they do have some flutes and brass instrumentalists behind them	thats pretty unique for a modern band
oh well my favorite movie much less disney is alice in wonderland  its the best movie there is	well i guess thats a matter of opinion but i do like that movie a lot too
no getting around this answer the question	darth vader any day
there are some interesting fan theories ive seen online about the saw movies	well that piques my curiosity im more interested in the fan art ive seen
what are some comedies that you like the most	i think some older comedies such as billy madison happy gilmore and waynes world are quite enjoyable
spielberg and mark burnett got together and did this competition reality show for original video submissions	i must have missed it
i thought everyone has seen them	sorry to disappoint
it is starring real mayan and ethnic people from central mexico	wow that is authentic
i always thought dez bryant was over rated	hes a good receiver who opens up the field

yeah i know it sounds stupid but it was kind of the music of my time  it doesnt sound too bad when you realize that some people call it emo	yeah i remember emo
i dont understand what you mean how do i make money watching someone else do something	exactly go and do for yourself  even if that means going to play basketball yourself to at least reap the physical benefits
i am also looking forward to learning more about lando	definitely    hope donald glover learned something from the coolest  billy dee williams
yes  its not rap music	ok  ill listen to them and see if i like it

yes and she has never really been given such a complex role before she starts to show her personality in different ways	the dark swan emerges
yeah its a good thing music is forever	good music like the ones from motown
yeah youre right since it is a concept album	i think they were inspired by the beach boys pet sounds album
have you listened to wildflower yet	i am not sure i know what that is
man this is how fans create beef that wasnt there at the first place	hahaha that was just my thought
shes not that good	have you listened to her she can do any style and is classically trained
sometimes you can barely hear the vocals though	all depends where you are
but i love it for some reason i wanted to watch that movie again and again as a kid and i had such a crush on him in it	thats a weird character to have a crush on
yeah shes more of a minor character but her character really sets forth the motivation for miles character to grow up	maybe the feel good moments in perks of being a wallflower were more powerful for me i remember feeling really good victorious free when they played that song in the bridge scene
no they werent friends	how did it happen then
how come	no one deserves to get paid 34 million for being in a movie thats 2 hours long at least if you ask me meanwhile school teachers barely make their bills its not fair
yea stop living in the past	dont forget about atlanta too
yeah i do tooi wonder who is going to be her opening act	i wonder if she  is she going to have an opening act
hey mom were we still having to go to philadelphia this winter	we have to in order to see your uncle
did you like it	it was alright could have been better
between michael jackson and madonna who do you think sold more records	definitely michael jackson im guessing he sold twice as many records as madonna
lets hope he gets to play he was looking good the season before he got hurt	i know and if not i think sam bradford is still there
snow white is an annoying character	she is i like the evil stepmother better
go giants were going to do very good this year	i believe so too i cannot wait to get to metlife stadium to see some games
that one does look pretty good	we should go see it on opening night at the imax
who is that	river phoenix
so have you seen any good movies lately	i saw beauty and the beast last week
oh i heard about that what does it come out	i think it premieres on the 7th
wow must have been a hitters game huh	pretty much  mud made the defense hard
from what i understand they start exploring the internet	the whole video game world is full potential there are a ton of fun ideas to play with in that mythology
i think theyre popular among girl fans in asia	probably just because of their appearances
scarlett johansson is the big star but it has a bunch of other people you would recognize	so they have a party and someone ends up getting killed
me too	what song is your favorite
what do you mean	for example when he goes to kill medusa in the original the fear of getting turned to stone looked real in his eyes like he embraced the role
which album do you like	i like decemberunderground
yea they just build a team around brady year after year	yea they are the epitome of a team they just win
well its kind of a dead genre	what do you mean
oh yeah  i really liked that one too	i liked it more than supermans dead and the others
me either i am glad they are making more of the movies to hopefully explain his actions	me to  the way they drive the cars around with the stunts makes it a great movie to see
yeah they were crazy  basically kill someone you love or die yourself	yeah it was like all a distraction look here so we can fool you
what is your favorite song	get off on the pain
i think it was called dna	oh yeah that album was hot
i do believe you are right	he rapped a few songs with them if i remember correctly
like which ones	i want to hold your hand  ones like that
it was sort of atmospheric and heavy	sounds delightful
yes	he is always good in a leading role
yeah but you gotta think that the offense will take a step forward this year	im honestly not so sure
have you heard noahs stay together	yes i like the carefree attitude in it
oh yeah i love that album whats your favorite album	ok computer
he was one of the founders along with roger waters  they had a falling out and roger waters left the group	does david gilmour have any solo albums
have you ever gone to a dallas game	no but i did go see the seahawks once
same here movies arent the same as they used to be	i know its all about the money now
i know right i mean emma watson is my favorite actress she is just amazing	yes and belle character suits her perfectly
why would that be	all their music sounds the same nothing about it distinguishes it from anything else theyve produced
i think the plot for vol 2 just wasnt anything special  i could predict everything that would happen	but dont you think that adding kurt russell onto the cast was a brilliant move
well you have the overture then the courrante the gavotte	ok i have no idea what you are talking about but it sounds great
that explains the video for that song then	i thought so she had lost her innocence of childhood and the believe in fairy tales after her prince destoryed her
did you see levis recut the 501 again	yeah hopefully it fixes the stitching issues on the inseam
yes dumbo is actually terrific  it has one of the best story arcs ever	i had never thought about that aspect just such an old one i forget about it sometimes
i like aladdin too didnt they make a second one	i think so but it had a different person as the genie and it wasnt as good
patriots i would say the steelers	nah theyre good but they arent that good
thats pretty cool	i love my old nfl cards
do you know any of them	yellow submarine is one of them
her dress is the prettiest i think	even though the pink dress was pretty the one the fairy godmother made ended up being beautiful
i know it is cheaper on dvd but this movie might be better in the theatre	very true i know it won a few oscars and awards
that had a really funny line in it and simon pegg is hilarious	yours
i dont know if they wrote that one but i know they wrote some of the them	did they all write
i thought it was a bit slow too i also wouldve liked if the alien was more visible throughout the movie	yeah thats a good point whatd you think of the weakness to water
i dont know i think i really like stuff from the lemonade album	i agree that album just blew my mind
i think he about 41 years old now	oh okay that is old for a quarterback
i see dead people is still one of the scariest movie lines ever	thats for sure
what do you think about wonder woman	i watched this movie last weekend as i was surprise
you need to listen to it it is so great	that sounds great to me
that lady was so evil though trying to take the diamond	in the end it all worked out for them though
they are on the right track	well they are tanking for sure
they dont even have a similar style	true it is unfair to compare them
do you like harry styles	ugh no why would i like boy band music
do you know any of her songs	ariana grande  i would know them if i heard them but i cant name any off hand
so whats your favorite artist in this genre	to be honest i like all of them they dont sound that much different
oh cool how was that	it was very creepy
yes he is tough too	i remember him in american pie
no the camping part was on regular ground	that is good because sand is annoying
thats so cute	it would be if i wasnt sick of the song  there could be worse things though  i really do like moana
what is good	i am doing good
yes he was aweful	hopefully she will find someone better
all they do is win partner stop hating	and all you do is run with the front runners
did you like any other bat man movies	yeaha few i like the older ones
well just have to hope that james cameron gives in and allows a release with the unedited film or at least the option to choose it over the pan and scan version	yeah im sure itll happen around the same time as he releases those avatar sequels he always talks about
i cant believe hes gone he was another genius	he played all the instruments that ever was incredible artist dont last long it seems
yes i think he is very talented	i recently watched a movie called striking distance that was really good
have you seen his earlier films	i dont think so like what
hes a rapper not too wellknown but one of my top 10	well i havent heard of him but maybe i heard a song of his what are his best
have you seen anything good lately	i saw the new guardians of the galaxy last week
yeah that was too bad  he didnt keep up with the times and his partypop style went out of style	yeah i watched the vh1 movie about his life and it was interesting  i remember saying im hyped like he said when he was getting ready to record a song
theres a song called swish swish on it with nicki minaj its pretty catchy	i have to admit im not the biggest nicki minaj fan
no	guardians of the galaxy
exactly that kind of moving line and illustration	i can totally see that
experience of course books adapted into movies should run smoothly	i like harry potter
oh my god i just saw a horror movie and it freaked me out	thats their purpose
hes the person who sings wild world	oh okay i know that song yeah i like that one
yes and geoffrey rush	so what was the original like

august 6th i believe  jerry jones is gonna be in this year	i heard his wife was going to be a presenter
they have a new one which one is that	its called something just like this and its with coldplay
a lot of people forget some of the supporting cast too	like who
oh so which genre do you listen to	i usually listen to rock
paranormal activity was pretty good	it was and made you think about if it could be real
its been about 5 years actually but yeah they just put a new song out a week or so ago for their new album	cool whats it called

nah it is nothing like that it is all awesome	well maybe i will give it a listen
so my better half is obsessed with the movie knight and day	thats the one with tom cruise and cameron diaz in it right
inside out was such a great animation film	i thought the tones of it were amazing
like jim carrey  there is a goofy guy	you know jim varney would have been good at playing the mask
yeah but some of the more specific titles i really like are dvd only or missing altogether	i havent come across that situation yet what kinds of films do you watch
chrisoph was pretty good too	yeah and everyone thought anna was crazy for marrying a guy she just met
since force awakens lea has been in the older movies and now the new one	yes she has so
nice observation he will want to get better	he is a few years younger then brady but has never won a superbowl
that might be fun	well their you go problem solved
really what was it like	basically while the other person says something critical or nasty to him it sounds really loud and causes him a lot of pain
absolutley when obiwan talks to luke about his father he was soupposed to have been the best pilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior	oh i see how could a nine year old slave kid be that

maybe but new guys will still respond to his unique ways	yeah always compete
how many albums do they have	i dont know the exact number but it is somewhere around 30

whats your favorite rock band	i like led zeppelin alot
do you think we keep big name talen like suter and parise around	yea i think we are just a couple tools short of a cup
i think lilos sister nani is a great character watching that movie as an adult and hearing it nanis situation makes my heart reach out	do you have a favorite princess
he really did johnny gill came into the group and really upgraded them though	oh he definitely had the best voice of them all
i guess you wont be watching the new one then	definitely not its not for me

who plays lando	donald glover
maybe one day well get a great swan song from nicolas cage	the world can only hope it doesnt involve bees
the series certainly spanned a long time i find them slightly too dark	they are dark but it is based off the books and i mean they had to start making them more adult

me either the hateful eight is worth it though because the clues and smoking guns are so obvious and plentiful that your heart is on edge throughout the entire movie	so are there protagonists in the movie

why would i want to be bored for even longer than an hour	trust me some documentaries are really great and fascinating you just have to find one that talks about something youre interested in
have you seen all of the harry potter movies	yes i like all of them except for the chamber of secrets
whats your favorite music genre	what do you mean genre
so then you actually are a later beatles fan huh	i guess so i learned something new about myself today huh

yes i can	what about the lion king
he is from michigan	what are some of his famous songs
too bad they havent been able to make it to the super bowl	i know i think we just need some more consistency
are there any movies about pro wrestling that are any good	the wrestler with mickey rourke is pretty good
like abbey road	yeah that and the white album rubber soul
i dont know i just dont trust a country singer turned pop singer	to be honest she is probably a better pop singer than she was a country singer
i really liked i want to hold your hand seems so tame to the lyrics the kids listen to today	isnt that the truth i guess it does make one think of yesterday
huge fan huh	no i have daughters
nice  what type of music do they perform	they are more of an alternative rap hiphop and dance  it is good music to listen to to exercise and take your mind off of the day
he was amazing but not the best as a lyricist	thats true he just related to people and had passion
he played marty mcfly	he went back in time
they are cute	i love his music too
umm what is that	its a movement for tuba solo
anselmo had side projects going super joint ritual down but his main problem was heroin and this led to the demise of pantera	what did you think of damage plan

it is on that note it is by billy joel and a lot of his stuff is really good	oh really
cool	they won the super bowl last year
well not to give it away but the ending battle took forever and was just way too much special effects	seems to be the norm these days
i doubt it as annoying as it is we may be loking at another new england super bowl	unfortunately kinda takes some of the fun out of the season
which decade do you think had the best rap	20002010
yeah man hes a talented guy	i guess he has to be with his looks

i really liked the last star wars movie it started slow but i really liked it	i havent seen that one yet what did you like about it

i guess that would be a tragic theme who did you watch the movie with	i watched it with my parents

me too hes a very good guitarist	my dad says hes one of the best
when did it come out	well the original was in 1959 and the newer one was in 1999

not if you wear a camisole and slip underneath its not	so dont
for me the music was the best part	agreed  awesome music
it is a south korean film that is intense	what is it about
she loves singing soundtracks from movies	disney ones
you know this one was inspired by an actress that jumped off the hollywood sign	wow thats intense
that is not even really a kids show	it is a kids show that adults can watch too
i thought it was great i really enjoyed the film	i did as well
hey did you see the titanic 2 movie trailer	what titanic 2 how can there be titanic 2 didnt the titanic sink in first movie
that means for me that rodgers is number 1 quarterback in the nfl and he can take his team to the superbowl	i think you are forgetting the team has to do their part too
why not  shes a great singer	oh shes good  her music is just boring
i think its because iggy isnt authentic people can tell	nicki is authentic at least youre right iggys australian isnt she

like i used to love i touch myself by the divinyls i didnt realize what it was about until i was in my 20s	oh wow yeah that would be embarassing
youre telling me man  what he pulled off last year against atlanta was pretty sick	hope the falcons can bounce back this year i like matt ryan
did you know richard obrien was living as an unemployed actor in london during the early 1970s and wrote the movie just to stay busy	no i didnt wasnt he the greasy haired butler in the movie
yes did they do any other albums	i do not really know

look what happened to todd gurley	yeah hes a great example
who plays today	senators vs penguins
what did you think of the movie beauty and the beast	i love that movie
oh man im a steelers fan do you think the browns will be any better this year	i think so i have a feeling jabrill peppers will be real good
nice what about today	to be honest i havent listened to much of his music recently
he was the most consistent producer on the ol during the season	hes learned the calls and most of all he had to help carry poor play at both g spots for the majority of the season
fashion usually says a lot about the villains i usually can tell what their motives are by their outfit	not necessarily true a lot of them of been disguised in everything from spacesuits to old 1940s ear maid outfits
not funny mate meek mill was missing his lines for gold bar all through drake came of worse even fell off stage at a point	no way
youre kidding	nope it was one of the best shows ive ever been to
me neither they played great the past three games and then just lost all desire to win	classic capitals  the curse continues
even with subtitles they bother me	yes they do not bother me
seriously if i was the mom i would have said to get out	i know he could just invent other things
me too i thought it was a good second movie in the series	have you seen anything good lately
ya i am looking forward it it but i am a little leery	afraid the quality will slip like from album one to album 2 and that you wont like number three
they make a cute couple in the movie	i love princess movies they are cute
im not a big fan of that one	not a big fan why not everyone loves that movie
no i just seen the new one the force awakens	what did you think of it
really why him	well he broke so many boundries in his day

porn	dont worry i dont watch the stuff

new england almost did it a few years back but then lost the big one	yeah that was a shocker another reason i dont like nfl much anymore new england and all their cheating
i like when movies can be both funny but tell a message	sort of a funny moral you mean
thats for sure	i wonder what happened to them
no is he a new rapper	yeah but he be out for a minute
and she has perfect hair	i guess ready for the muscle guy
werent two of the band members brothers	yeah i think the singer and one of the other members  did you ever get into motley crue
probably hidden figures	oh i have heard of that one that is about the women who helped nasa right
actually have you heard his cover of hurt	no who is it originally by
he should have just let him go if he wasnt going to play him	he finally got released to play a good season in kansas city
the new installments arent as good as the old	disney has kind of downgraded the franchise somewhat
i really love watching brady	me too he is literally amazing
she was in some of the fast and furious movies	ive never watched those either i cant believe they are still making new fast and furious movies they sound lame
i disagree  i love it	glad somebody does

i also like sturgill simpson	yes hes wonderful any other female artists
what is your favorite song	oh probably  surfin usa i used to pretend to surf ha ha
yeahive been to a lot of other festivals but warped never really appealed to me theres a couple good bands playing this years	really who
in regards to sith or not	well i love sith
i really like that one but i really like the goblet of fire	i like that one too of course but why that one

i agree too much fake music being promoted	whats some good stuff from nuno im always looking for new music
i have heard of it what is it about	it is hard to explain but aliens and corss dressers and music
i love when modern rock bands cover the beatles	oh that does sound cool
ummi think there was another one but i did see into darkness the other night	what did you think
in ancient times were mainly used for signet rings and large earrings	but did you know that many modern cameos are carved into layered agates  the layers are dyed to create strong color contrasts
sure did but then there was a light haze all through the mountian winery and its an outdoor stage	yep he encourages it i think
what did you think of jar jar binks	i did not like him as a character he felt really out of place
i doubt its that weird what is it	i was listening to the talib kweli song called for women and at the end i started to cry
shes had a bunch of songs but i dont think any were major hits	i dont think ive ever heard any
have you seen lala land	i did see lala land
you heard of the name drake	nowhat kind of music he play
my friend jose is the drummer and he absolutely rocks it	i think i have heard him play with a local rap band

have you heard anything about the movie mystic river	yes thats one my favorites
ever hear buckwheat catapillar	buckwheat caterpillar a band
i wish they had made it farther in the nhl playoffs this year	they lost to the ottawa senators who just won another playoff game today
what are some of the songs about	some of them are about ellen degeneras which is about 90 of all the lyrics
i want to see the movie wonder woman	yeah i forgot that movie was coming out soon
i want to rent a movie tonight got any suggestions	what sort of movie are you in the mood for
yes i found i would think about the movie when trying to go to sleep	i would get scared that my husband would start screaming in the kitchen or something
im sure they do but they certainly can rebound to that point	i read about a guy named chipper jones and he was really good but why isnt he in the hall of fame
i saw sanctum recently its a thriller movie about an underwater cave diving expedition	what did you think of it
yeah and the year before that too	well they are the best two teams out there  itll be a great finals
i think hes still the quarterback with the washington redskins	i think that sounds right
i am not a snow white fan do you just like her or are you a fan of the movie as well	the movie is one of my favorites why dont you like her
why not	dc is not putting out very good movies
how did they win this game shooting so poorly	they played smart by not turning the ball over
how do you feel about lady gag	do you mean her clothes or her music
i also think jameis is a much better leader he is a lot more relaxed	i cant disagree cam definitely looks a lot more frail when you look at his press conferences
have you seen the movie frozen from disney	yes i have it was such a fun movie winter is coming
he is a great artist	i love his pain is love album
people keep raving about that how was it	well i dont know im really sick of superhero movies to be honest

desperado is the coolest track on the album	i can listen to that song all day
what songs did you like	brick in the wall was great
who directed it	steven spielberg
what song did she perform during the  88th annual academy awards	it was  til it happens to you
yes	and hes a drug addict
which one is your favorite	id have to go with jimi hendrix
i really like the in time movie	is that the one with justin timberlake
speaking of which seems the curse is broken on the cubs	yeah go chicago that was so close
yes her halftime performance was amazing	i like hearing the newer material
afraid you got me there too	streep is there anything that woman cant do
are you going in order by the way	no i am not naming them in any particular order
dream on sister dream on	ill be happy with what nightwish gives me
doing okay	yep you
shes a good one	yes i love all her songs
i find that acdc has a more edgy sound wouldnt you agree	i guess i found that metallica changed a bit in the 90s and became more alternative
how long did you think	like two or three
oh really	yea i honestly dont know the band that well
not really blade runner is more science fiction	i like older films
yeah that guy had some wicked eyebrows i think there were 2 sequels that followed	there were lost boys the tribe and lost boys the thirst and spawned the franchise by the same name
for sure but bad blood is so good	and blank space is great too
ya i noticed that also i thought it was strange after what had happened with hans	ya and he turned out to be a bad guy can you really trust cristoph
what is your favorite i really like beauty and the beast	i do too  i hope to see the live action version that came out in 2017
and then later in the series for han and leias son to turn to the dark side	i know and then he kills hans i almost cried
did you see any of your bands life	no i just like to listen to them on my mp3 player
that kind of sounds like a monty python skit	its really the same kind of humor
its simply called jason bourne it came out in 2016	i havent seen it then arent these series based off some books
surei will let you know when	there are a few others that i think are good as well
theyre a little too heavy for me i prefer some classic nirvana	true nothing can beat nirvana its such a shame kurt cobain died so young
i dont knowi didnt see it	i hear that it was good
do you remember hoodwinked	that kids movie from forever ago
that their real names seem dorky	that could be it
yeah he is but he looks a lot different now	all i can think of when i think of zac efron is high school musical
but a good character	but who could forget timone and pumba
really that is surprising	horror is too scary for me
imagine that in reallife 9hr flipping burgers but if your productivity goes down youre fired	meanwhile in the nba if you miss 23 of your shots you still are rich its crazy
it really is a great movie the ode to the food and mardi gras especially the gumbo	that scene where her father comes home tired and exhausted is one of my favorites especially when they invite everyone to join them for gumbo
i love indiana basket ball and indiana university has not been the same since miles brand fired coach bobby knight	that is a fact bobby knight might very well be the greatest coach to ever coach college basketball
thatd definitely be the best example theres a lot of other ones though	punk rock comes to mind
whose your favorite nfl team	that has to be the lions
then they should end the franchise	i believe they are very soon
yeah life is too short for skinny jeans	agreed
which band do you like better	aerosmith
why do you like the dolphins so much	its my home town team and because of ace venture
it is a good album but my favorite is wildest dreams	also a good song in truth i like every song on that album
its just the suspense and mystery that make your skin crawl	oh i actually do love the creepy mysteries now i think about it
yeah they like trying to capture the 21 jump street magic by making stuff like baywatch	yeah which looks really bad
talk about clutch under two minutes tom brady	i swear tom brady has had to have sold his soul to the devil
yea i have a few signed as well	bills jerseys
it definitely feels more intellectual that way i like both styles	thats respectable i wish i could get more interested in newer rap music
barbossa wasnt as creepy i ended up liking him a lot	the scenes with all of the pirates fighting together in the third movie were my favorite
so you want me to pay for snacks	sure if you can that would be good
whats your favorite song from tupac	i really like california love
those are good songs	what songs do you like
that part always brings tears to my eyes	me too it has a lot of emotional scenes for being a comedy
who do you think might end up being mvp	i have no clue a few good quarterbacks to chose from anyone can surprise you
i saw her in an interview but i dont remember who played her	elizabeth banks she is so sweet it was a good role for her
i didnt 3d makes me feel car sick	i have heard that before i have been ok with it
do you plan on watching football next year	i usually dont start watching until the playoffs
true but that would have definitely been me if i was in her shoes im such a clutz	she was in trouble from the start though the matchmaker was not a pleasant woman
are you getting pumped for that new star wars movie this winter	yeah ill definitely go see it
what you doing	just practicing
inferno is a really great album actually dont listen to it enough	can you really ever listen to motörhead enough
so do you think mel gibson should be able to direct movies	well theyre oscarworthy he does a great job
no i dont think it is very good	i hear you the sound seems too artificial
i think the people acting in the film want to look better so its better acting	sometimes its a bit too much though
oh yeah  so check out the new one  its no reflektor but its catchy	nothing beats reflektor
the lead singer is jenny lewis do you recognize her	no what other bands is she in
yes it is  i am so excited	ill bet  you seem to look forward to the football season every year
yes iconic movie scene especially when they go past the moon	some good 80s style in that movie as well
yeah it was great the best ive seen in a while	what was so great about it
it was good talking to you	go browns
yes  awesome	what type of music to they do
the nhl and the nfl have it right with a hard cap	yeah it creates more balance did you know that only about 8 teams have won the championship since 1985
it has been a few months	that is not good you should go more
it would be great	lets go together
i would have to go to an old favorite i love psycho	you cant go wrong with that one everyone feels something with that one
i know i was disappointed in them as adaptations but i still love them	do you have a favorite
who is your favorite star wars hero from those movies	lets see jar jar binks
its pretty much all singing	like ally and aj
do the dolphins belong in this group	no miami is a midlevel team with some promise but ownership and management do hurt the dolphins regularly
i remember the video was insane for that song	now he just talks about drinking beer and being old
yeah it was really different from anything out at the time kanye kind of took over after that	he did its too bad he ends up saying so much outlandish stuff on tv now
what about it didnt you like	it was very hard to listen to the music didnt really work with itself
yeah he is not that good	that sounds like you are being
i know i saw naomi cambpell wearing the most gorgeous burnt orange atelier versace gown recently it was covered in sequins	i loved that one too did you see what she wore to the golden globe awards
are their jerseys like hanging up at the kings stadium	i know webbers number is retired though
and war of the worlds would that qualify	i suppose a science fiction thriller for sure
who is your favorite band	mastadon
its good a little morbid	morbid
you can say that again	it was nice to talk to you
i love the song i walk the line	yea that one is good
vader just killed obi with hardly any effort	obi was too old at that point
ok got it	probably you didnt like it because the leak is just the unfinished version
yeah it is hard sometimes	why
yeah same here	yep
no really they have a good team	with that offensive line they should
and the challenges presented by scar	at least he has nala by his side
agreed the way he fought luke and choked out all the admirals that failed him	i also liked when he first became vader and killed all the padiwans at the temple
i can not wait till it comes out	me too they have shown a trailer of the movie
it could have probably been trimmed down a bit	her recent output often feels a little too much like she is chasing trends though rather than setting them like she used to
i will definitely look them up and let you know	ok cool i definitely needs some new rock music in my life
its my favorite	i can see
did you ever see oldboy	no what is that about
as good as they played do you think they can beat the warriors	i dont know if they keep playing like that they have a good chance
what was your favorite scene or funny line	i actually loved the scene where its a cutting to different parts of him looking for francis
i mean trout got his deal right away	thats why i think hes done quicker than we think
one thing that still impresses me about the series is the visual effects they are fantastic	oh for sure there is so much detail in all of the transformers i couldnt begin to imagine designing much less animating them
i wanna get tickets to their show	i heard they are always sold out
what was your favorite star wars movie	return of the jedi you
what first got you into watching star wars	i just randomly saw a part of one of the original movies and i thought it was really cool  i ended up renting the original trilogy and i was hooked
i still feel bad she was such a good actress	i agree who would you be interested to see in this movie
wow i remember those places do people even go to the mall anymore	i doubt it
i think its overexposed	you mean to many games on
would you have gone	for sure
the action the humor the heart boy did this movie have heart i really cared for all the characters	chris pine was really good in this role it seem like he was going to be in a similar position of character as in star trek with his captain kirk but they developed his character really well
yeah i positively loved it	i havent really got to see it just yet
his voice was a little irritating in the film	thats what made it so good
well well find out soon	not soon enough
well they are making a sequel of it	oh thats great i loved the first one
thats true and they might want to give him a better contract so they dont lose him to another team	it would be a shame if they lost him to another team because they dont appreciate his talent
yes they did a great job	yea the storyline was cute and the music was really good
yeah that one the one that didnt succeed	when the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king what he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight and hell win the whole thing fore he enters the ring theres no body to batter when your mind is your might so when you go solo you hold your own hand and remember that depth is the greatest of heights and if you know where you stand then you know where to land and if you fall it wont matter cuz youll know that youre right
well you remember that woman darth vader type she led the stormtroopers	oh you mean captain phasma
do you lke rowlings books and the movies	i love the harry potter series
thatd probably be fast  furious 6	that films main theme was so great
ive been poking around online and trying to find all the older bands i listen to	like which ones
why do you say that	he was one of the original gods of rap if you will that paved the way for the rest
what concert are we going to	we are going to see a girl band
rhinana makes some	i thought she only did pop
do you like old or new disney movies better	i would have to say old because i grew up on them
i just got back from the mountains and listened to country	that would seem righ also folk
buthow does she survive i dont get it	she goes into a coma for years and when she wakes up she gets revenge upon bills group by killing them off onebyone enjoy
when was the last time you watched star wars	it was when i saw revenge of the sith
i saw woman in black yesterday	wasnt that the creepy movie that came out a few years ago
i know she is in the princess diaries movies	oh right she plays mias grandmother
i like how it keep the same voice actors	thats true
maybe but i feel like that was overdone	nah they can hide their bodies
yeah john farrell has decided to go with the hot hand at catcher	i like that strategy
do you think it is wrong to download music for free	yes i think it is wrong especially when you can stream songs for around 10 a month
yes or otherwise it will end up like all of the over remake flops	i already know part of the storyline is different
yeah that  was confusing to me too i dont like that it almost left the door open to him coming back but he never did	it was definitely one of the more unique deaths in the movies who is your favorite character in the movies
did you find the lion king to be a sad movie	overall i did not find it sad but that part where simbas dad died made me cry
elliott he does well as a child actor	i remember the big scene with the red hoodie and bikes flying in the air
the alarm kind of reminds me of that time period too i mean for boy	thats a good band wonder what ever happened to them
the question of how they got the information to beat the death star	so many people died though
did she ever do anything solo	oh yes for many years but i couldnt tell you one of her songs
im not keen on all flower power designs though on the clothes from the 70s	me neither  the current style bell bottoms dont have crazy flower patterns on them
yes and then they practice the rest of the week	and during a game they stand around while the clock is running so in all they play like 20 minutes a game
what about the cubs	the cubs still have one of the most dangerous and young lineups in baseball
i know i like the nostalgia of his old tunes	my favorite album is probably darkness on the edge of town
kind of bittersweet now since robin williams has passed	im grateful for films like aladdin that captured robin when he was at his peak doing what he did better than anyone else in the world
the main one that comes to mind is tainted love by soft cell	that was such a great eighties song
i look forward to it too	im loving 2017 movies already
yes	nah because thats like saying beyonce does soul music and sade adun does rnb
haha sure once you learn to ice skate you can learn how to play hockey its a lot of fun	i dont think ill ever coordinated on ice enough to play hockey
ive heard of it  did it win any awards	it won academy awards for best picture and best director i know for sure
who would you say is your absolute favorite	the beatles
edge of tomorrow	thats that one with tome cruise
i know right no one would think of that name these days	what are some of their songs that i might know
i definitely will it will take me right back to being a little kid again	im glad i thought of it good luck
yeah i guess theres a lot of player turnover as they graduate and bring in new talent	yup  you like basketball
thats correct but they never really talk about his hits in japan that much	i still find it incredible the amount of hits total he has as a pro
ive seen it a few	i want a sequel to that one
i have always been a big fan of disney movies either animated or live action how about you	absolutely to be honest i don’t know many people who aren’t fans
yes hauer system they dont have the rule 3	weird
agreed he was but i think he is too old what team would pick him up	maybe a team that has a young quaterback draft pick that needs a veteran presence for a couple years
yes they were	nice talking to you
i know its not a good choice but his role as the riddler is one of my favourites	why not a good choice
whats one that you watched recently that was really bad	i watched baywatch that was pretty rough
its a lot different than the nhl playoffs which are going on at the same time where the players specifically talk about the game to the media	its almost like the nba players have a premade speech during their press conferences and only say what they want to not answering questions
i dont have anything against classics but i dont have all day to sit around and watch movies i try to cram my social life exercise and entertainment experiences all into one evening	that is kind of sad you cant do all that in one night anyway she is going to be starring in a movie called good time
ill admit that she didnt seem to hit some of the high notes she used to	some singers lose range as they get older
like what	horsefeathers and the 1975 are two ive been into lately
me too or friday the thirteenth	yeah lots of 80s slashers halloween was the scariest
i thought logan was fine not crazy about it	really i thought it was the best xmen movie
yup	an no injuries on either team the camps look good
imagine a rap world without him	hes revolutionized rap music and brought in millions of fans
true hard to belive he only has one oscar	did you finally get one
totally agree with that assessment if the texans were just able to fix their quarterback situation i think that theyd not only win the afc south for years but that they would also become a legitimate super bowl contender	whats crazy about houston is that bill obrien was hired because hes this supposed offensive genius and hes already gone through several different quarterbacks in his short time there
sounds like a great movie	i definitely recommend watching it sometime
which one should i watch first	well if you are going to disney world i would watch cinderella
theyve been in two of the last three super bowls	they won two of the last three super bowls
how many main characters do you remember there being	i think there was two couples involved
do you think jack sparrow is getting too old	what do you mean
it is my favorite as well	what is your favorite scene
well thought he made the perfect lucius fox in the nolan batman trilogy	agreed anything else
but i thought you liked them	i only liked one of their songs
how about the high humidity movie with nicole kidman	that sounds like the only movie i want to see i am a reformed man hating single mom however it would be fun for one day
its not	no  his mom and dad died protecting him
yeah i tend to like pauls songs more than the others paul mccartney is a genius songwriter	he sure is i think he got the short end of things when compositions were credited always as lennonmccartney
well they traded stauskas picks and pick swaps for nothing and it didnt work	true they needed to clear space for free agents and they got none anyway
cinderella found her prince and they were happy	yeah every good work has a happy ending
so now that you have finished the entire series what is your final snape opinion	oh wow i dont even know yet i am still processing i think i have always felt like snape wasnt evil
well just get me both drakes and kendricks cd	alright bro would get them
the music really added to the film	the music was very good and i was glad to here familiar songs
seriously man they are crappy every day	i know they have a revolving door of players
nwa was a great group	yeah i love express yourself
whats your favorite disney movie	its got to be aladdin
oh interesting i like action scenes involving giants	yeah and it was funny too it had that guy from step brothers with will farrel
have you heard that saving abel has a new lead singer	no who is it
i liked how captain jack sparrow was a typical drunk pirate but was still super dynamic	the music was really good too
i also started listening to august burns red again	really  what songs are you listening to
i love listening to stuff on vinyl	yeah me too
its called issues and she performed it at the bbmas	oh thats her i love that song
but they get to the truth of things	do you have a favorite one
arizona cardinals are always good too i just dont think carson palmer will lead them to the promised land	i dont think its him we need to worry about david johnson had an amazing season and will test teams with his style of play
what do you mean	i mean its not the typical slasher deal  he kills them in improbable ways
i really like vin diesel in the movies who is your favorite character	paul walker
what character was your favorite	out of all of them
that was sometime in the 1990s right	i believe it was the early 1990s i think the saints were so bad that they even screwed up that celebration
they definitely want to end that drought	i agree it would be nice for them to make the playoffs this season
its probably the most enduring movie of all time	id have to agree with you
agreed plus her acting just made me cringe	nothing beats the disney version
classically bad	well dont discount other peoples tastes dont go to the dark side
die hard is one of my all time favorite movies	it was bruce willis best role
you mean youll be in my heart	yeah that one it makes me irrationally choke up every time i hear it
so you think lynch is gonna be just like old beast mode again	i hope so  he retired young so he can still be good
true that is a good point	who is your favorite actor in the series
but the nfl could form a partnership with one of the daily fantasy companies	thats not a market they want to go in
yes shortly before he passed away too it was appropriate	thats sad i really like that song
did you see miley cyrus on jimmy fallon the other night	yeah i did what did you think of the new singles she performed
yes i am and proud of it all the guys and their vocals and their music is great you cant tell me you dont like the song story of my life	okay okay ill tell you i do like that song its very catchy
those are names of the pieces that use the scales	yep
that sounds amazing	you have to do the same
we could listen beforehand if you want and then decide	that would be good what should we start with
what do you think of video game music	i dont really listen to that kind of music a lot
exactly  he lost his family   and his money	yea sad story   really sad
thats like the 3rd string qb that was ahead of brady on the pats first career pass was a 70 yard hail mary then he was like 29 for 20 yards and an int after that	still better than 08 he could have at least thrown an interception then we would know he was at least throwing near a receiver
you into superhero movies	i mean ive watched a few
with jay z	yes
have you heard their making a live action lion king movie	no way whos in it
yes or beyonce	i think that the last album i bought was actually adele
you dont care if they commit crimes	no of course i do i just think that after they serve their time they can get back to their jobs
its funny how when it comes to classical music or modern songs theres no sense of exclusivity to them	what do you mean by that
you know whos good the new qb for the vikings	oh yeahi cant think of his namehes good
yes i love patd	they havent released anything this year yet but theyre so good
i am hoping it will be the pats versus the colts	yea im not a big colts fan either
do you like the original thor	yes it is different
its fun to listen to	it is but the lyrics are a bit distracting they dont match the harmonies
it is considering the patriots are one of the top teams in the nfl	with 5 super bowl wins how can you not say the patriots are a good team
i would like go to the movies but it is so expensive	i know what you mean
what have you been doing lately	nothing much just been watching movies
have you watched any harry potter movies	i watched all of the 8 movies in the theater indeed
because hes so cool	fine man but will you quit complaining
the celtics may have to make some line up changes if they want to increase their chances of winning	yes i agree i guess we will have to wait and see
but lebron has years to play	that is right jordan is done
we havent won a super bowl yet	oh really why not
so sgt pepper is 50 years old	yeah i guess it is theyre releasing a new version of it now
i would love to go but i cant afford the tickets	i will sell them to you half price
do you have a favorite action movie	let me think
i like romantic movies but not sappy ones	ok that lets out any nicholas sparks movies
deseont he play for the lakers	yes but he is so good i would like to see him play in a stadium
which ones in particular	i love dear zachary
would you rather go to the movies or rent a movie	i prefer renting because going to the theater gets really expensive  how about you
i agree like they could be real people and studios know better now than to use women as cheap laughs	it helps bringing more women into the production process like wonder woman
what are you talking about you cant do the incredibles 2 without frozone	thats what i was saying but you never know
so he has powers	not really he just kicks butt after being revived i dont think that counts
yes offfield drama can detract from a players value but the raiders really need someone like gareon	they wouldve done just as well with jabrill peppers
what is your favorite nirvana album	i dont even have one
great song by him	you know who else i really like
i liked him in beautiful girls	does she get him
cool are they good though	part 2 and 3 are both very clever films
i guess the one that comes to mind for me is when chunk shook his belly	that was classic
do you think disney will ever make another inside out movie	i hope so that movie was hilarious
i like her name is she actually called enya	no her name is actually eithne pádraigín ní bhraonáin shes from ireland
thats exactly it	she needs to do more age appropriate music
i just think its weird that he just decided to tell all his friends good luck and disappeared	hopefully they were do a good job explaining that in the next one
really i dont think the critics liked it that much	who cares what they think
the one with andrew garfield	yes
i wish i could play that	me too but maybe i will learn
the slow voice singing of the song also relaxes the mind	i like to hear that
why do you have to go by different years just who is overall	because you have say steve young 1993 vs joe montana 1988
oh yeah remember hearing that on deadpool	yeah a lot of people do but thats not where i first heard it from
the civil war sure was tough	that movie really showed you a lot about how it was in the south during the war
that game is so sweet	yeah it is i love that game
they will need a brinks truck to carry away all his cashno unnecessary distractions	i think he is the real deal jerry jones the boys owner does as well and he signs the paychecks
well they butchered the ending but a lot was the same	oh no i loved the original ending
so kind of eclectic taste then	ya i am little bit all over what about you
yo you heard of family force 5	nope
totally i love day games in the summer nothing better than a sunny afternoon and baseball	yeah its one of those things thats as enjoyable as when i was a little kid
do you mean like james bond	well i have seen all of them but it goes deeper than that
did you hear system of a down is touring	what i thought they broke up
yes they were sort of just there for cringeworthy oneliners	that was indeed probably the movies greatest weakness
have you seen a lot of nba games in person	i have seen a few i like the international ones
same here the whole peter parker dance scene was really stupid	i argee  topher grace as eddy brock
yeah so he isnt afraid there	or something like that
did you know they were married	really wow that makes a lot of sense
yea  i havent done that in a while	it should be a lot of fun
can you name others	maybe
i almost left the movie crying during some scenes	i loved that they answered some of the questions that needed answering from the cartoon
i think my favorite character was the ship itself	yea or the iceberg
yes but thats good and bad the only person who got the perfect score mcinally wasnt drafted until the fifth round	thats weird
yea and he has a good defensive coordinator to run things in kris richard	they sure do have a lot of talent on defense as well and that always helps
the only down side is some of the people from that movie seem to return	well shame they should have just forgot about them
oh i am a big fan of bad romance which is your favorite	my favorite is just dance but i also really like bad romance
did you know flubber was a disney movie	no i should have
ill agree that its catchy but id hardly call it interesting	its a success for a reason
i loved their super bowl team	me too
theyre in their own category it seems	and they wrote so many classics  i enjoy their songs so much
its been awhile since i saw that one whats your favorite part	maybe when harry uses the broken toilet immature humor i know but i watched that scene over and over
that was unexpected do you like all of their more rockoriented albums	honestly i am like i said i appreciated them for the risks that they took
i like that one a lot	yeah it is one of the best horror movies ever made
have you seen tge original star ward trilogy	ueah but i think i only remember star wars
helen hunt was the waitress she played a good part too	yes she did shes a good actress
i can get why the vocals alone are an acquired taste	i just dont understand how anyone can like music with unintelligible vocals

i would have to say baseball	i love baseball its really exciting
who is your favorite actor	for tv or movies
not just that but have you heard about the theme parks	no what
i wonder what the earliest musical instrument is	thats easy human voice
sounds like something youd like since youre super nostalgaic	yeah but theyre a good decade older than me yet i still got the references
i didnt see that disney movie who else you got	disneys first black princess was named tiana and played by anika rose
what is th sound like	need to breath is contemporary with a touch of what i would call bluegrass

tame impalatheyre an indie band	no havent heard of them what did they make
how much is his last cd	it shoudnt be  to high its worth it

most people dont even make that much a year	now you know why hes broke
john travolta was also a good part of the movie	i liked how their small conversations were so memorable
yep and she finally got her revenge in the end	yes and she was able to wear some pretty sweet outfits
yes that was a classic scene	i really liked leos work in that one
i hate star wars	why whats wrong with it
yeah i think its great as well	do you know when its coming out
probably the senator was always trying to play with annakins conscience	ill bet that if annakin never knew senator palpatine he wouldnt have joined the sith
have you seen the movie rough night	yea that was hilarious scarlett johannson was great
they looked fine with cousins and should have built around him but now there is all this drama	yeah they always seem to have issues
that the dodgers had a lead and were swining at 30 pitches	see this is what gets me mad about baseball

he used to be great for the bengals	hes still put up decent numbers with the cardinals

i heard it was action packed and fun to watch	are you planning on seeing it
it has to be him	well at the end you will see the guy with the limp no longer has a limp
come on xmen the last stand was a joke	that movie gets a bad rap
the people who were supposed to be bad had me sort of rooting for them	i think that was just good acting on their parts
they were also revolutionary and brought something different that ive never been there before	there songs and lyrics were awesome
get out jordan peeles psychological thriller his term and i am not your negro the documentary about james baldwin	they were all great movies all three of the ones you mentioned i saw them too

well youre in luck he will be in our area in july	oh yeah where and when
i really loved seeing the team they made come together and do something amazing	yea they beat a god
i bet we could or the demnim jackets with all the concert buttons on them so retro chic	the leather studded pants and jackets will definitely be a hit with the big leather studded hobo bags
yeah but thats part of what makes it so exciting	then youve got folks like roethlisberger who just sit in the pocket and take on all comers
what about horror flicks whats your favorite	i like a lot of them but nothing with too much blood and gore
i felt the same way it made me reevaluate and look at the movie from a whole other perspective	i guess this means we will be seeing a unbreakable 2 movie in the future
yeah  like hoping things will get better and this will be your year	exactly  how about drops of jupiter
i thought it was my bad thats not even dmx	you listening to tommys theme

didnt she sample an abba song	yes i think its called a man after midnight
it was produced in 2010 and it was one of her first records	what are some of the songs on it
yeah im positive he will do it again this year and they will make the playoffs	wouldnt it be cool if the patriots played the cowboys in the superbowl
oakland raiders versus the philadelphia eagles	where was it played
i wasnt too thrilled with the movie we watched last night	which one was it
they werent i thought andrew garfield was a solid spidey not enough to hold up to tobey though	well well see if tom holland can outshine both of them

the steelers will knock them down	no joke
maybe so i couldnt imagine having to eat sardines	yes that sounds disgusting

yes they are very beautiful	mendelssohn has a very whimsical quality
i personally want to watch the new despicable me movie	oh i love those minions  they are so cute
yes the end was sad to me as well it took a minute to realize what was reality and what was not	the crimes committed by the doctors i think was the worst part of the entire movie
but golden state could survive without durant or green or curry	i am not sure thats the case
i personally like my church and 80s mercedes	i think i know who she is did she do a duet with dierks bentley
love it	me too
just sitting around	sounds boring
is it one can never have too much rob zombie in my opinion	i do enjoy his music
maybe sparrow and star witness are great songs youll really like them	ill try to find the album maybe its on a streaming service
who is your favorite xmen	thats easy wolverine
i was a big of the dinosaurs	yes those special effects were amazing
he has twenty some personalities and a few are really bad	it is scary im scared easy
the thing that really got me about this movie was the ending when andie realizes that she loves him and she goes to the cafe to wait for him when she sees him she runs out and into his arms this stunned me	really  it was just an ordinary romance i thought
get real	name one
i loved the movie carrie	one of my favorites

what did you think of it	the animation is amazing
not that recent	not to start with but theyre still going

how rex ryan getting the boot again	yeai know
rooting for the dark side eh	someones gotta

so are any of the ladies in your top 5	yes laura hill she was so great she was so smooth   she could sing and rap she was one of the greatest rappers period

it was released in 1982	it is a science fiction movie
yes he wrote songs with john lennon theyre considered one of the greatest music writing pairs of all time	i remember so many beatles songs ive also seen a cover band that was very good playing their music
i have been though	well try music it can help
i know i dont know what his deal is	do you think he could turn it around and pitch well
do you think steph curry and kevin durant will become the next top players in the league	curry is already breaking many three point records and has won a championship  durant is an unstoppable scorer but still hasnt won a championship yet

is it just me or is ariel mean	what are you talking about
he threw the puck in the other goal and won the game	no freakin way really
yea it is time that they make some noise in the afc	i agree and i truly think that they will this year

run like an antelope	haha i like that name
yeah that really landed him on the stage	yeah its funny he doesnt look like it but he has such a great voice
its funny is it not	jim carey is a hoot
come on who else could have had everyone at the superbowl singing one song like mccartney did with hey jude	thats true but for every song like hey jude that the beatles had they also had songs like taxman which were kind of mediocre
what do you think about correcting pop and rap lyrics	what do you mean
exactly with the top minds in the magical kingdom thinking its okay i mean come on	yeah anyone could see thats a terrible idea

have you ever listened to young jeezy	i think so hes all about the trap scene right
it was so great when he jumped out of bed to go to the chocolate factory	i also loved when charlie inherited the factory and told his family
its clear because so many of them went on to have such great movie careers	dan aykroyd had a successful time with ghostbusters with bill murray
i had heard all about that scene before i even saw the movie myself	it was apparently a big deal
like the show ed	no he did not know as ed did that he was being filmed
he is a great artist	yes he is i really like his song thats my kind of night
oh yeah i forgot about that	yeah thats why i didnt like it
unsettled is a nice way to put it	haha its kinder than terrible

which artists do you like	i have a wide range of artists within the rap world that i listen to  from will smiths bubblegum rap to dmx or tupac
they were good even after they started turning guys over	havent heard from that  franchise since he left
hello	hi
who are your favorite nonmain characters in disney movies	oh like not aladdin or woody
she was fabulous	didnt she struggle mentally for awhile after that movie
at least three i think	good boston just scored two more
i know then she lost her power	i am glad things worked out for them i am looking forward to the next frozen movie
yes i told her to start with breakfast club sixteen candles and even valley girls	who is in valley girls
simba was my favorite too were you scared of scar	yes scar was the worst have you seen the little mermaid
i was i wanted the patriots to win so badly	im guessing you were pretty happy with the outcome then
yeah that was a good one quite poignant	some of those scenes in the india slums were pretty tough to watch
some of the special effects make it worthwhile for the big screen the battle room is awesome	okay im going to go look up theaters that are still playing it thanks
the longest was one for 24 hours and 55 minutes it was done by david didonato who set the record in 2012	man that is crazy i bet his fingers were sore after that
oh thats hard to choose i think it would be angela lansbury singing the main song	me too i love that
i bet with all the complicated scenery	yeah thats what i was thinking  well it sure generated enough revenue to make a profit though
do you like the actor that plays ant man	yes i do i think t¿hes a pretty decent actor
that album is important	a sign of the times kinda
so what was your favorite disney movie when you were a kid	its kind of hard to pick just one for me i had a friend who loved beauty and the beast and my mom loved mulan
harry style has one called sign of times	i heard that song did not know it was his
wow that must have been be exciting for him also	yep it was
he was on fire before he got so banged up last year	yeah jets management will never cease to amaze me
that was the first song i ever heard from her	me too it made me fall in love with her music
i would love to see more of her too i havent heard much about the sequel have you	no i just know they announced they will have one
i know  who do you think theyll get to replace him	i dont know  im sure whoever it is will be a disappointment
but at the same time the other humans looked at him as an outcast	that is the sad part they treated him like dirt and basically almost killed him
yea i agree but another must see is beauty and the beast	oh yea i saw that
how much is it at target	25 i think  seems expensive
i felt so bad for the old priest marin he walked into that house knowing he was about to give his life	ive seen the uncensored version with the spider walk down the stairs that was absolutely terrifying
they werent helpful at all youd think after she called so much they would physically come to check on her	maybe it was because of the bad weather
i have seen that one loved the new york setting	youll really enjoy sleepless in seattle then
they play the warriors	i will make sure to watch that series
i agree and judge is already at 15 in his rookie season and we are only in may	wow 15 already i did not realize it was that many
you might end up bored	well that is fine
basically anything without a super crazy vocal range	what about no air by jordin sparks and chris brown
no what do they sound like	they are more of a metal band
ok ive got a beach trip coming up and im panning on doing lots of reading so id like some good reading music	got it i like having music on when i read too
did you know there was a taken television series too	yes i did  i didnt find it fun but it was renewed by nbc for a second season
i love when they keep saying shake n bake in talledaga nights	me too they are even better in stepbrothers
yes the idea that she is a princess they need to rescue but she also knows how to fight the bad guys	of course a very strong female character and not someone who sits around helpless for the whole movie
cate bauer	i loved the song cruella de vil
i wa thinking about doing a star wars marathon this weekend	that sounds cool what order
its funny when they all take the polyjuice potion to look like harry	yes i forget which movie that is in i also like the weasleys house
weird then that youre really into this other band that sounds like them	ha maybe although i think the joy formidable takes the best parts of muse and strips out the stuff that i came to not like about of them
the cowboys offense should be just as good as last year	prescott and elliot will certainly be the key it is just their defense is going to be their obvious weakness
what are you looking forward to most about this nfl year	i want to see if the falcons will bounce back after last years loss
i hope one day youre proven wrong	me too itd be fun to see but deep down seeing a female get tackled fullforce by a 350 pound lineman hurts to think of
i love a hard days night	yeah thats got some really great lyrics
powerman 5000 im not familiar with that band	they were formed in 1991 and the frontman spider one is rob zombies younger brother
did you ever see the american pie movies	i saw the first two
woody herman and andy wiiliams	what happened in the third quarter
does he live	no he dies at the end
oh the cast is really good you have mila kunis kristen bell kathryn hahn christina applegate	oh then i definitely have to see it i like mila kunis really much
it is the life story of a famous drug dealer known a boston george	where did it take place
you know ive never seen it	its a great 80s movie
if the cincinnati reds are the first team of baseball do they play the first game of the season	they dont and i think it was the cardinals were the first to play this year
from 2029 to 1984 was his time travel	it was arnolds first film success
were you aware of what happened to one of the members	yes i heard she died
why not	because amateurs do it for the love of the game they have to learn the love of the game first before they can love the money
yes her voice is like shes been drinking an alcohol since birth it sounds like chuck berry	i dont believe this
it was good and yes its the one with the fake actors	who was in that movie
yeah sure  i will definitely do that when i get home	thanks man  i am always looking for new music to listen to  im interested in skylar grey now you have piked my interest
i agree	now you know why i think hes the best football player of all time
i think that one bothered me for days  days	i dont think there are as many thriller movies as there used to be do you
yes thats the one its the reason i dont like clowns	kind of like stephen kings cujo thats the reason im afraid of saint bernards
next time i will watch that and breakfast at tiffanys	wait you have not seen that
what type	i like symphony the best
i also loved the superbowl moment when john elway flung himself sideways over the endzone line for a td	he had a pretty good run those last two seasons to end his carrier thats for sure
i guess i see what you mean there	im not saying hes not talented you know it just felt kind of fake
did you like him in spies like us	that was such a funny buddy comedy
do they really need expansion though	not really the qaulity of rosters isnt that great right now
is that how most music people want to be remembered	as long as they are talked about
yes she is	she has a new song on the radio
what time is erics ball game today	it starts at noon but were supposed to be there about 1100
i feel your pain as i am a jets fan	we can yell at our televisions together
he goes through the oline like a knife through butter	i am thinking he is gonna have a big big year
man who was the eagles quarterback back then	ron jaworski
yeah they can explain what he was doing living in the desert for all those years	the starwars saga has many more chapters ahead
my favorite character in finding nemo is mr ray	he is awesome i like how they made him the teacher
i miss that too	it is a great love story
which	home alone  theres a short fugue when kevin is preparing the house
there was a little with matt damon and the chinese girl which is the only main female character in the movie	oohh is she cute
why the first few rows	you would be right by the boards and see some really cool upclose action
haha i would have to agree	i mean all of their songs sound the same
are you going to see wonder woman	im not sure yet im kinda burnt out on super hero movies
he gets shot and killed by the guys who are trying to kill his brother the hit man	too bad  anything else
unfortunately he retired but not until after winning another superbowl with the bronchos	doesnt he have a brother
i think steve yzerman had a lot to do with it	he was a pretty amazing captain the red wings have had some really good players over the years
yes i had no idea vader would turn out to be his father	that movie is full of surprises
i have seen all youve mentioned and wonder woman is sure on my list as well then spiderman homecoming get out and ghost in the shell	oh damn youve seen ghost in the shell the preview was something else i was already dying to see itoh now yo saw it before me lol
is that with the rock and vin diesel	yes and charlize theron is in it too
i may want to look into it	you need to you would like it
yeah im listening to perfect illusion right now	have you heard her perform it acoustically yet its incredible
yes it is with that win we swept the series against them in seattle	where did you sit
it seemed like when i was growing up there was a bigger fanbase for it but in hindsight i think that was just my family	same here
hey man you know travolta is a amazing actor	well duh
yes like he has had many songs on top 100 on spotify	i know ive seen him on spotify a lot
the new one	no the cartoon  something about it just feels magical
yes rodgers when hes on comes pretty close to brady what other quarterbacks are up there	ive always liked ben roethlisberger but he gets hurt too much and may be tailing off now
did you catch the los angeles game last night	i went to bed early did i miss anything good
you need to slow down the pace sometimes	i guess it could make a bigger audience happy
you should listen to dream mate the song is so cool	coming from you i would have to check it out i know you have a good ear for music
interesting take vader as a weapon	well did the emperor just use him more or less
yes there was	well no one else saw it
yeah its called ripped	was it good
yes	who was the director
do you like kubrick movies	the ones i have seen yeah
so this is important why	because you asked how debussy used them or soemthing or other i dont remeber
cool every play any jazz	just some awful improve with my friends
thats funny	who do you like
one person i hope he is not is palpatine  he was a great bad guy and powerful but hes gone	i agree if they did bring someone from the past maybe someone supremely powerful like darth plagous
okay i like them	have you heard their latest album
what about 98 degrees	yes they are too
i feel that the falcons will be contenders as long as they have ryan at quarterback and julio jones at receiver	yea jones is the best receiver in football as far as i am concerned
yeah the force awakens was made on film not that it really matters	why doesnt it
ok what do you consider real country	cody jinks zac brown chris stapleton any of the red dirt country musicians
what is your favorte team	i have two because i cant choose like that
yes especially when you saw the two coffee cans with their ashes in them at the top of everest	one of my favorite parts was when edward took carter to the racetrack
hes a pretty decent pitcher	he more the decent  he is the ace of their staff right now
i just got this new cd	really  you buy cds
yeah one is that he was mace windu one thing even said jar jar binks	ha that is crazy but i think that he is something completely different
i like her too  i used to listen to eminem often as well	his music is  always so interesting because it tells a story
so where did you see it at	i seen it at home i was going to go watch it in theaters but im more watching like action movies in the theaters
i agree  at first just my kids liked him	i can see why they would like him  i think now he appeals to more adults
well the new alien film definitely looks interesting but it isnt released until the end of the week	right we could go see that because i love scifi thrillers
what are some of your favorite artist to play on the guitar	i like playing the blues and some rock music on it
i am serious girl  they watch it at least twice a day every single day	oh  now i understand what all those internet memes are about
i know i felt so bad for him	and i hated amy adams
like pride and prejudice is a movie based on a book by jane austen	i think theyre okay it helps if ive read the book before seeing the movie though
i think it was the song	a lot of teenages can relate to that song
two weeks we should try to get tickets	we should but i like to be right down on the ice
probably cause of money its always over money hahaha	plus i think kandi slept with him or something like that
what is the name of the album you are listening to at the moment	this album is called heavy weather
will smith did a great job in it	jared leto if anything was better than anyone in it
i should check on my collection to see if i have any more of hers	i probably have some as well
for sure i think it will be a great series	me too the spurs have a shot
no but i want to	i heard it did not get good reviews though
to some extent but im not sure how far or how deep anyone has taken the idea	that would be a cool project maybe even something that would be worthy of a book
mike zimmer is a great head coach	who does he coach for
he was such a heart throb back then	i definitely had a crush on him and hes talented win
do you like kevin bacon movies	love his movies
a girl had them and took me on a date	man youre lucky
what do you think of rock music	i really love it i just wish more people i knew were into it
those are great romantic songs	who are some of your other favorite females in country music
what did you think of the squirrel	the squirrel in that movie was cute and it was funny how he bonded with kronk
what about his personal life	he killed uncle ben for no reason
i know i think i want to watch the movie again now	you should its one of the last great animated films
oh it had two avengers  ha thats funny	oh i hadnt realized that but yeah there were two
right so if they wouldve just run a few times they probably wouldve won	not that you are complaining though
i know what you mean i get busy too	yes and now i can see the movies that i want to see when i have time and without leaving my house
no it wasnt my favorite  not that there was anything wrong with it	no its just that i have others i like better
cant knock the hustle is a classic	that thing is timeless my dude
yeah take your time	like favorite band of all time
do you know who the beatles are	sure
because i said so	geeze
i love the lion king and the music is great so i would still go see it	yeah i would too
two of the games were very close in which the yankees won by only one run  but in one game the yankees won by a score of 116	really were the chicago cubs ahead or behind in the games
that darth vader lives really	if its him why does he live in the place his life as anakin ended
i was amazed at how well theyve done so far i was into houston	come on really the rockets im surprised your rooting for them
well one is called free as a bird its a really good song but kind of sad too	yeah john lennon died way too young he was a great songwriter
did you feel they covered the major well her back story as well as some of the key points that made her character so interesting in the manga	they certainly did i think they did an even better job of making her plight sympathetic to the viewer they added a bit more to her background which helped you to understand how shes feeling and what shes thinking
you know what i think	whats that
okay well that does sound pretty silly	my point exactly thats why i didnt watch the new one
it really was  i cant say anything else about split without giving anything away but there are connections with m nights previous films	now im really excited about it  who is anya taylorjoy
emma watson has a pretty good voice too	i loved her as belle she looked the part perfectly
there are so many other acts showing up with new material too like grizzly bear phoenix and haim	its a great summer for indie thats for sure
you know there is not one song on the american top 40 that i would buy right now or even listen to again	same
how do you usually listen to your music	i like to just play youtube on my phone with headphones how do you
do you think they will replace carrie fisher in the next star wars movie	i dont know who else could play leia  she passed so suddenly
dont underestimate the team though they have a lot of new players	yes i see they signed a new quarterback
no really	really
i probably will too	thanks
yes they said it would be released in june of 2017 then they pulled it but i heard they are doing the sequel and possibly releasing it in 2018 or 2019	i hope they keep brad pitt as the main actor he did great in the last one
which one	the second one
why do you think nickelback is so hated	i think people think their music sounds all the same
why	well first i have glasses so it makes it tough to watch them  besides that i just dont think it adds that much to the movie
yes and i also like the puppy song	who sings that song
ovi said hes going over	he should stay there while hes at it
hes an icon	yes he is
she loves electric music and djs party sound track she dance to those most times at home	okayill be right back let me confirm something
i guess they still did really well with it overall	true true
what is your opinion of pink floyd	i am not too familiar with them so i really dont have an opinion
why not	i think he was good for that style of offense
even though he gets hurt a lot its time rob gronkowski goes off the board  he gives you production like a wide receiver does  besides its fun to say gronk	i like jordan howard next hes the only weapon that chicago has  hes a lock to get 25 touches a week
do you like disney movies	i love them
do you remember marcus allen	or sure played for usc
those bastards	well to be fair 2030 of the ticket revenue isnt going to keep a theater open but price gouging on all them sugary fat delicious stuffwell they kept the theaters profitable
it was a good movie it was a lot of soap stars	corbin bersen was in it
yeah matt ryan isnt as good a quarter back i dont think	i also dont like the steelers or the patriots
it is called the house	with the gambling and will ferrel
im going to miss keaton and bale but aflick seems to be pretty good so far	i know and that was the part i worried about  i cant believe he was awesome and the rest of the movie struggled
yeah they are not many bands can consistently bring out album after album of good material	i can only think of a few lcd soundsystem the national and arcade fire all come to mind
i have to agree with that for the most part	but i still like to cheer for the underdog
especially considering the tragedy that isiah thomas went through	i dont know how he played so well after his sister died
it is mario and luigi are two italian immigrants living in a dystopian city and the goombas are essentially dinosaur people	what now that sounds just plain bad
i loved ac dc	oh yes pour some sugar on me
no i did not know that what was the song	considering she is 27 years old so she has been making music for a long time the song was called pon de replay
hopefully everyone stays healthy for that	well if the cavs and warriors keeps sweeping they will have plenty of rest
has he put out any tracks recently	yes he has a song called privacy that is doing very well on the charts
have you watched any new movies recently	sure i watched alien covenant because im a huge fan of the alien movies franchise
it did not do well  i think they were way too focused on making it serious	yeah these movies are supposed to be fun and escapist
what did you think of the last super bowl	i thought it was great  very entertaining
it was pretty good it wasnt quite as depressing as i expected but some sequences are so heartbreaking	i havent seen it yet so dont tell me anymore
guess coach thought he was	true
i dont think they get back alex smith is unspectacular and i cant see that defense being as good this season	the afc north teams should be better i could see baltimore and cincinnati getting the wild card spots
i feel lately he has come across badly on screen and off	how so exactly
i would love to take a month or so and see as many concerts as possible	what a great idea lets start with acdc and aerosmith and go from there
how about nicki minaj	i would say shes more of a rapper
you are probably right	yeah we are stuck
is that the song where she sings oh its so sad to think about the good times you and i	yeah thats the song
i think the players on the golden state warriors are all skilled	yeah they all pretty much can shoot 3s and dribble really good
well ill be looking forward to that coming out	ill let you know if i hear anything else
do you have a second favorite	yes i would say bad moon arising
did you think it was funny	at the time yes but its child humor so not anymore though i still like it
they are so loaded on offense theyre 3rd stringers would start for most teams	possible they go 160 this year
whats your take on the music in star wars	i like a lot of it
heart is legendary my favourite is crazy on you	thats a great song what about never
it will be interesting to see the divisional games between the falcons and the bucs though	for sure  the buccaneers added desean jackson to mike evans  that move alone puts two big time play makers on the field on the outsides
what is your favorite disney and pixar movie	i loved ratatouille
awsome	do you like pink
i really like michaels voice i thought he was most diverse in what he could do with it	really i like kevins voice his was so unique compared to the other 2
i think we can limit this further would you choose alternative over reggae	yes because it encompasses more of the music i like there is alternative rock alternative dance alternative hip hop etc
i can agree with that i dont think their rankings are exactly accurate though	true it does depend a lot on the amount of support the player gets from his team
they could flip the script on all of us	i think you have a better chance of jabba the hut being a human
well whats a song you would recommend	lola is a great song its about a trans person and accepting them its a great hard rock pop song
yeah bruh its intense but its by smith so its funny too	funny how is getting turned into an animal funny
my husband and i finished all of the harry potter movies finally out of curiosity who was your favorite character	i have always been a traditional harry fan myself he is just such a dynamic character
no not at all	well they did change a few things
i have blizzard of oz	i dont thats a good album i have diary of a madman
whats the one that bugs you the most	easy aayla secura my love being distracted by a freakin bird and then shot about 100 times in the back
is it pretty nice song what about you know any good bruno mars songs	yeah bruno mars not really a fan of mine so i dont really listen to his music
ok you know how everyone says if i won the lottery id die of a heart attack	yeah i probably would too
they have everybodys number could you imagine the steelers super bowl trophy case if not for tom brady	how many conference championship games have they played
i just cant believe you have never seen pinocchio before that is crazy	well lets watch it now then
that part reminds me of the silence of the lambs	i think that was what they were aiming for with that dog
yeah right you wish	i dont have to wish hes great
yes sound plays a bigger part than most think	i couldnt agree more
i enjoy her as well i love that she plays the harp to	i adore her but i also liek a wide range too say julie brown and alanis morisette
my favorite is scenes from an italian restaurant	that is a fantastic song and it was amazing it got played on the radio because it is so long
that is a great idea	i would start with dylan scotts song first since it isnt as heartfelt
probably  who is going to give denver trouble in the west	probably kc
who is your favorite player on the new york rangers	ryan mcdonagh is having a great year for the rangers
they need to sort of organically create personality	i agree with you on that point
tyrese is amazing in this series	i agree he was specially awesome in the 4th movie of this series
i can hardly remember most of them past the first one	i thought the books were better than the movies
what about the one direction boys many of them have their own singles	i know theyre completely on their own
while i would disagree dre as a whole im a fan would still agree overall	yeah snoop is classic oddly enough i think the stuff he did with dre was better than either of their stuff alone
the tortured soul	yeah  he had so much to overcome from his childhood i dont know if i would have turned out different in his shoes
kind of frat guy humor	its a coming of age story
what did you think of the way the force awakens played out	which part
they are very catchy and fun videos	better than gangnam style
i will any proper albums i should hear	he has too many to recommend just one
yeah and lost all of them	well they are my favorite team
do you think he will break any records	maybe not this season but i think he will break some records
like this is serious	how serious
anyway the music is awesome they have clear sound not too loud	really
oh wow i dont think it is that deep	it certainly is
do you think fast and furious movies are becoming repetitive	well i certainly do feel that to a certain extent
oh yeah  who else was in that who died young	john candy yeah rest in peace big fella
now that was an underrated movie	its probably because it came out in theaters around the same time as forgetting sarah marshall
what was the most pleasant surprise last year	what do you mean  moviewise
ill have to check them out	yeah you should all three have music on youtube and itunes
i dont seem them doing much this year	drew is still pretty good
no pachelbel actually the canon in d solemn joy it was horrible	wow ill just take novocaine
im not a huge fan of it	keep listening i think it will grow on you
did you see the remake of petes dragon	yes i did did you like it
i love them	me too
oh well is a million ways to die in the west any good seth macfarlane also made that	ive never seen it ive heard mixed things about it
but is hollywood that trashy	anything to make a dime
i loved that song though i didnt actually hear it from guetta at first	what do you mean
this was a trick man i love the beatles and you just picked their worst song	aw what the heck man not cool piggys is a good song
well they certainly wont ever be able to top their season in 2008 where they went 016	hopefully thats not a performance they will ever want to repeat
why belle she really didnt triumph anything	not true belle used compassion and morals to overcome her obstacles as where ariels answer was to make a deal with the devil so to speak
hi	hey
really i wouldnt have guessed that about you	yeah im really into the lethal weapon movies from the 80s
his latest song is cosmic hallelujah	oh i think i just heard that
on saturday i will see something funny	but this movie was not bad
oh i love the packers	really they are my family team
that is what ive wondered about as well its legal but doesnt seem like something an nfl player should be doing	well i see people like gronk out there all the time partying though
yeah you should theyre gonna be contenders this year for sure	they almost were contenders last year but they had some bad luck
what is your favorite song of his	my name is
i know kiss and metallica will always be the golden age to me	i agree they just dont play like them anymore
seriously its too slow for me	i love it i really realte to a lot of the songs
oooh i think i am going to have to buy the dvd	trust me you wont regret it
but there was no hulk or thor	true but they had everyone else except doctor strange and those two
whats your favorite type of music	i listen to all genres of music but my favorite is rock n roll
too ghetto and gangster for you	yeah exactly there just isnt anything good or positive about his music in my opinion
but goodies	no doubt
why did he leave the boss alive thats so stupid that you would want to make a deal with a russian mob	because thats not what the chapter 2 is about
its pretty dope huh	yeah but it feels to me a little suspicious
do you have season tickets	no but id like to get some
dont spoil it for me ill watch it soon	youll love it another good mystery kind of movie is butterfly effect
no way dez bryant and dak prescott will lead us to another nfc east title	ha you wish carson wentz has some new weapons and an improved d were headed to the top
lots of literary references one of the band members has an mfa in writing so i guess hes witty	that could be interesting
well you are a fan of aphex twin right	yes so
for sure and the songs can really get stuck in your head	yeah i find myself humming just a spoonful of sugar quite a bit
yes thats what its called that was the one when dory had to go and find her own family	yes i did see that one it was even better than the original
yes and he shows those clowns whos boss	yes with peanuts and all
yeah i dont understand why	its probably because of the stigma of them being arrogant and such
i am into everything	you gotta be more specific than that do you like chilled out music
i love her new album joanne	she named her album joanne
was it good	oh we had it on vhs and we watched it like every week
do you think they have the players to do that	probably not but brady is going to burn you either way
last year jets and dolphins tickets were going for 10	okay let me rephrase it is expensive to see a team i care about
yeah i agree and it was just ridiculous when they introduced jarjar i mean who likes that character	jarjar was such an unnecessary character but i liked how they introduced the concept of a grey jedi
what about the lost boys	they were awesome
what artists would you choose	i would choose country artist thomas rhett and pop artist kelly clarkson
yeah  im just hoping someone will beat the friggin patriots  that belichick stinks on ice man  is there any way to cheat that he hasnt thought of	if there is im sure well see it this season  what a jerk
another foul this time by smith	they were trying to play keep away
well what do you think i should do	maybe just come clean
you dont think people like that	no i think they like people they can relate to
not until management finally decides to fire marvin lewis you dont	i do not think that is fair he has gotten us to the playoffs year after year
really do they have anything new out	i think so i saw a new video on youtube
ive never listened to much springsteen	you should born in the usa would be the perfect album for a party like this
i was so excited about the first new star wars movie	why is that
i think im gonna buy tickets tonight	could you get one for me too ill listen to all their albums on replay tonight
that sounds amazing what a great idea	its a great way to enjoy the movies a little bit pricier though
true but they cant seem to catch a break	thats accurate and the texans are always pretty decent
it wasnt a big movie kevin kline stars in it	huh i cant even really picture him
it is just unrelenting	well that is interesting
its apparently a clowninspired ruffled blue dress with a cutout panel on the tummy	and thats not all she even wore fishnet tights talk about topping the list of the worst
i like rap but i dont like that gangster stuff	me neither who wants to hear about a gold chain
ill have to look into it	you should the score is great too
yeah i wish they had done more music together	yeah they would make a truly amazing duo
when do you listen to music	i like to listen to music when i am studying or doing work how about you

what do you think of radiohead	i think they are one of the most important bands of our generation
whats the latest horror movie youve seen	prevenge
i  liked the first and second movies the most what about you	my favorite was definetely the second movie
you have to give him props and admire his talent and skill	thats nice to hear from a non patriots fan

i am happy if more people listen to them i think their music can uplift the souls of people all across the world	it must be a powerful song thank you for the recommendation
but revenant he did such a good job in that  hes all mangled and dirty and just his facial expressions are great	agreed he looks like hes just running on pure hate for half of that movie
it really does shes in love and confused and wants to follow her code of honor and rails at herself for the mistakes shes made	and this is in the middle of a comedy
its already over though	and i dont recognize this
ok so jerry played 8 more years  thats why randy didnt break his records	its a factor but lets look at some of jerrys records

the bills defense was good they finished above 500 last year	yeah true maybe the browns then

i also really like the main cast for wonder woman too	yeah they did pick a good actress for wonder woman herself
wow i love it its not the type of music i listen to but maybe i should give it a chance she has a beautiful voice as well	maybe we should both give more music a chance there are so many great artists out there maybe we shouldnt stick to just one kind of music
hey	whats good
good on chris martin for not letting the haters get him down	i am glad his music hasnt suffered because of his divorce

i love when they are robbing the trucks	yeah that is pretty action packed
college players play in offseason leagues with minor league teams all the time and they often beat them and not just d1 college players im talking d2 and d3 also	college has a ton of players who are there to play college baseball and their dream ends

it is	alright i figured out what the scariest movie i have ever seen is

well  if i didnt listen to them too much only occasionally this means youre talking about the records he made i was not to fond of right	yes thats right i want to see if some of them are some of his records i may have not liked to much and lots of his music i did
i cant wait to see the matchup tonight between the steelers and the ravens	me too
yes  that is mine too	i remember liking everything about it as a child
kevin spacey at his best	could you beleive the end

what rock band is great live	nirvana was awesome
who is your favorite star wars character	my favorite character is chewbacca
we can all have these very separate media intakes and curated experiences versus a common ground we all agree one like sgt pepper	yeah i think so and so i feel a little nostalgic for those days but hopeful for the kind of new music these pluggedin fans will make
tupac is my all time favorite rapper he is a legend to say the least	there is no denying that his ability to write songs was amazing
our best guy is out there	who
ok i will do that and let you know next time i see you	awesome have a good day

my favorite is prince ali i love the scene during that song theres so much going on	aladdin and jasmine both had such cute pets too
do you watch superhero movies	i am a big fan indeed i have watched quite a few dc comic and marvel comic superhero movies
i can understand that odell still has a lot to prove he disappeared in the playoffs last year for the giants and thats not going to cut it	thats what i mean hes super talented and skilled makes amazing catches but aside from not knowing some techniques to lose defenses he has that temper
i havent seen them	they are so good i watch the hallmark ones for the whole season
have you seen seven	yeah it was pretty good  that was a total mind bend
yeah sure shes really talented	i was on the fence at first
oh yeah forgot you were aromantic	yep instant identification plus her singing voice
starring ellen burstyn linda blair max von sydow and jason miller	was it successful
i believe so yes	also didnt big papa get talked about a lot in the movie hardball
as a person she is hot as a character im not a fan	well who is yours then
ha they did have some good songs	see why should you feel guilty about something you like
how are you	well and you

heck yeah  packers fan for life dude	how many will they win this year
i also liked luke training with yoda yodas so funny	he is and it was great getting to see luke really becoming a jedi knight
no i always seem the miss the shows when he is local to me he was at the country 500 but i was out of town at a wedding	isnt that the big festival where he played along with blake shelton miranda etc
what do you think about the penalties the refs call	i think the refs do the best they can but they inevitably get some wrong

yea well it seems like if he keeps moving his lips he may be traded	well if he is traded i dont know who i would bet to win the nfl or superbowl
whats it about	its about a rescued dolphin that needs an artificial tale
when did they complain about adult life	in the song stressed out they said people make them wake up early and go earn money
i also love music for solo violin as well	have you heard anything for violin and piano
i thought starkiller base in the force awakens was awesome	yeah it was like a massive death star
ive never heard of them	theyre this band that formed in 2000 in long island
i can see that i guess	theres nothing like some good music to set the mood
you never listen to country music	not if i can help it
i saw a clip of kristen bell on ellen singing that frozen song	which one did she sing
me too i feel like renting army of darkness now and watching it  wanna join me	yeah i could use a good scare
would you see it again	i dont think so
i know im not getting in his way	can you imagine taking a charge from him when hes got a head of steam up
hard is an understatement	i totally agree  took me years to learn how to play it
jonathan davis has a very unique voice	he does they have a lot of really good songs
yeah its from the second album which was reviled in the uk	why that bad
overall hip hop is doing great	i just hope this greatness continues
that is a good song who sings it again	ellie goulding sings it
people will probably be really nostalgic about it since carrie fisher died this year	i think people will always think of her as princess leia
yeah its a sad world we live in	get used to it buddy
if i was making millions of dollars i woudnt mind wouldnt you like to see the season start earlier since there isnt really much sportsy	i wouldnt mind but i also wouldnt want players getting injured because they are playing too much
what year did it come out	i think it was 1998
does he still have a bunch	yeah i think he has pretty much all of them the one with abbey road is my favorite
yes he is	i liked the second the most
i think you can say that about any of the fast  the furious movies each film is adrenaline packed to the core	oh but what about that tank car chase in fast  furious 6 that was the most adrenaline packed scene in the entire series in my opinion
do you have a second favorite song	yesm just pretend
i dont think anyone but the band members know the real story  it couldnt have been very nasty though because gabriel did appear with the band in a reunion tour	thats interesting  i guess there wasnt too much bad blood about him leaving then
is that the harrisson ford film from the 90s	yep thats the one
yeah thats a pretty good followup act	yes agree
definitely and that song pretty boy swag is not exactly nas or tupac	yeah these new rappers are really lame i wonder if someone dropped on their by accident when they were a baby
headed home to watch it now	good
lets talk about music	great
the sequences just go on for so long i dont get how its even possible to hold so much choreography in your memory and make it look good	i think the third one is going to be even more epic they are great at stepping up the action for the next movie
yes they are	any new members
oh wait heres another one that was super cheesy  goodness attack of the 50 foot woman	holy cow you really pulled one out of nowhere
that sounds really freaky	well the ending makes it look like its not so bad
ow ow thats hurts	im sorry that was a bit of a low blow  forgive me bro
definitely true  i definitely like us bands	me too  i find them to be even deeper and darker than uk bands
well what is your favorite comedy	well that is toughie
houston is an interesting team  they have most of the parts	thats been true for houston for several years though
i wonder if he will have another hit like purple rain	that is one of my favorite songs of all time man
yeah shes great especially in her movies from the 90s	i guess this is the most recent movie shes been in  was it funny
yeah thats what i meant  he had a deep voice	yeah you definately knew it was him
when they train and fight it feels real not like models posing	how was gal godots fighting
it was one scary movie	still scares me today
it is my favorite season of the year	mine too
are you into cop movies	kinda i did like beverly hills cop with eddy murphy
they have been around forever right	yes
roulette and hey hey hey were my favorites on that album	tsunami and swish swish were good on it too i enjoy listening to those
yea the nfl	i love it
yeah that one eas my favorite	what about return pf the jedi
i know me too i wasnt even going to see it because it looked corny but my brother told me how good it was	yeah i really like seeing bryan cranston doing a variety of rolls he was so serious in breaking bad but so funny in this
for sure that was probably one of the better ones but the actual artists were involved in the production so im not surprised it was so good	what other rappers do you think there should be a movie about
nah i am still a cowboys fan always dak prescott and zeke elliott are the boys these days	yeah the rookies turned that mess around in dallas im glad tony romo is gone
they said security would be heavy for the paris show too of course becuase of the potential for an incident	the fans are really brave to keep going out to things instead of laying low at home
he has no musical talent cant dance cant do anything	but hes obviously popular
i totally agree with that  their offense was extremely good	i think they kept most of their offense  i do think they added some defense to the roster
thats strange because the subscriber rates are through the roof with both	yeah because of the original shows they are producing
where does that movie take place	in london and in neverland
did you see furious 7	is that the one where paul walker died during filming
he had such a beautiful voice and so good looking  yes heartbreak hotel was a great song	i use to have most of his records
what is your favorite genre of film	i dont know that i have a true favorite i like films on their merit
you too	thanks
yeah i hear he is good	he really is
yeah her and faith hill are definitely two of the greats from a while back	i would probably have to add reba mcentire in that category as well
really	is that suprising
i know right	they drafted well the last few years and seem to be going in the right direction
i love band perry	they are a good band
oh my god i think thats one of the best examples	right i couldnt believe it was him when someone told me
so he just walks around and stabs people with his knife fingers	not exactly he appears in peoples dreams which if you think about it is pretty scary
awww that sucks i like the haunted tape	ya i did too it just wasnt as good or fun as the old ones
yeah it was not for everybody	i thought they made eazy look like such a fool
have you seen beauty and the beast	no  i never even saw the cartoon from the 90s
wasnt vince vaughn in that	yes and luke wilson too
that was in the eighties	rock and roll heaven has got to be my favorite
right on i can dig it	i cant stand this rap nonsense you are trying to peddle to me
do you recall california love	that was a good song is that your favorite
well its an old disney movie from the 70s no newer actors	no wonder i dont know it
i know they looked so real to me	me too i also thought the kids who played mowgli did a good job
yes i remember my brothers listening to them when i was growing up	yes thats funny me too my sister loves sergeant peppers album
even if they dont win a superbowl the level of play of the raiders is much better than the past	carr is getting the tools and now he is going to have to make something happen
i would have liked to see more of them too they were great characters	i liked that they were good natured pranksters who couldnt like them
hell clarice that is one of the more chilling lines the way he says hello to her before he even sees her because he can smell her	i will have to see this now
the ohio express actually had a record or two before they turned into a bubble gum act  but they didnt become successful until they found what worked for thembubble gum music	ohio express recorded on the buddah record label which was also the label for another bubble gum act the 1910 fruitgum company
this movie gave me hope for the new era of star wars movies	i know i wasnt sure they would ever be as good as the originals
my favorite part is the end dialogue where meryl streep says she has doubt	oh i remember that part
that is a good idea actually	adele music really relaxes me what about you
i thought it was kinda silly	well there was definitely nothing silly about the shining
i havent heard of that one either	its pretty good though its a cartoon
when did you first listen to the beatles	when i was a kid i got one of my dads cds
what do you think about taylor swift	while im not a fan of the drama that surrounds her i have to admit that i love her sound
i guess youre right its just kind of sad to watch people rag on the creator of star wars	oh agreed i will never stoop to that level because he gave us such a gift
what types of movies do you like	i like old movies
no way that would have been so boring	youre right the ending was fitting
my father went to a charity dinner earlier and was kind of bored he was ready to leave until he saw a mans giants hat then my mother had to drag him away	im guessing hes a giants fan
oh so youre a roger moore guy	actually i liked connery more in the role but i still love moonraker
oh no when do they have to reach an agreement by	they need to reach an agreement by july 17th

well last week they had brown  flacco but they had far more interesting people in the begining of the summer	wait flacco cohosted
hey so theres this new movie i really want to see i saw it on apple trailers	whats it called
id have to say so	they basically have no other option lest they keep losing
if he gets on the same page as antonio brown its touchdowns for days	add in their explosive running game with bell and its near impossible to stop them once the offense starts clicking
robin williams was always wonderful	he was great in flubber also
yes he has a lot in his solo career	i am a big john lennon fan
thenruby slippers were silver in the book	wowno kidding
yes  she sings like an angel  do you think we will ever be able to get tickets	i dont know  but if we can can i go with you
it is really worth reading their lyrics	they are so good i have never done that i only listen
the second was a little better than the first at least	maybe but it still stank
i love them	me too
what about snatched	is that with goldie hawn and amy schumer
i heard that too but i guess it still wasnt enough	nope execs dont know whats good for them
want some company	i mean maybe
why do we not make one	that is actually a great idea
i know i cant figure that guy out	maybe they should trade him
yeah he never seemed too angry	pete was probably more of a womanizer
what is your favorite song from that album	my favorite song is called send one your love
were the beatles from germany	no they were from england
no i had no idea wow thats young	well he was only 16 when he released his first mixtape
they have been around forever	i like aerosmith too
maybe shes actually realted to obi wan and not skywalker like everyone thinks	or it could be both
i thought the movie was alright	i might watch it then
yes rihannas gown looked extremely uncomfortable and unwearable	i agree but i saw pictures of her at her after party where she changed into a more comfortable jeans and white tshirt
i did too the first i saw was the grateful dead in princeton nj jadwyn gym	thats amazing
yeah even justin timberlake and willie nelson covered it talk about overkill	yeah but i think the jeff buckley version is still my favorite
have you seen any good action movies lately	not for a while
hes just a wide receiver thats how they are  hes not as bad as to was	to used to crack me up
i love the sounds	why dont you have a home system then
i dont know just potentially the chiefs ravens raiders steelers or bengals	so the team they beat to go to the super bowl last year is somehow going to beat them
youre right about the electronic element  its definitely catchy	the only songs by one direction as a whole that was better than the singles was story of my life
thats a classic probably aesops best song	yeah that song still holds up really well
did you like it	i did
yes and a great 1st baseman	i really wish the braves would make it to the world series again
i guess that would be kinda cool if it were true but no it isnt	oh well thanks for telling me im glad i never said anything to anyone else about it
tonight you free	am i free for dead pool sure i am
im guessing he was the voice of absolem again	yes thats right the movie is dedicated to him
3 did you not see them all	i think i just forgot i know i saw 1 and 2 not 100 on the third installment
oh definitely have you seen deadpool	yes i have over and over ryan reynolds is hilarious in it
why does that matter the fences part	well they can play me as deep as they want thats one thing i hated about little league  i had dozens of homers over the years robbed because there were no fences

it means not your daughters jeans	i have never heard of those i remember levis was the only jeans anyone would wear
what are some of those	well peter murphy went on to have a fairly successful solo career
im hoping the superhero movie genre does not get stale	i dont think it will look what they are doing with the avengers making single movies about individuals superheros and then putting it all together
i do feel like he could have cut some of the songs out though	definitely that cd is long
always you know he can never not have krizz kaliko on his records	cool i really like krizzs flow and style dude can sing too
what is your favorite song	my favorite song is longview form the dookie album
whos your favorite player on the red sox	heath hembree
i knew hans solo was going to die harrison ford was getting too old	yeah i was still sad
sounds like a party to me should we start with some backstreet boys	i dont know i was kind of thinking nsync would be where we start
why do you say that	zeke and dak were good last year but rookies sometime take backward steps
jane  actually  starts  as a  dead  body in the  mourge	so its more  about  finding out  who she is
it most definitely was and its not really a horror film is it	not at all i mean there is a dead kid and kiefer sutherland plays a really bad dude but thats about it
yes and i hate it i always think people are evaluating my underwear	its meant to be cooling in fact it is cooling
yes i do i am inviting you to come over on september 7  we can watch the game together on tv	it is the patriots against the chiefs right
nope	i do like his character and tony stark becoming friends
28 weeks later	oh come on there werent any zombies in that movie
i would rather not have them ruin a movie	paris hilton made her scary movie almost unwatchable
so how much or little did you like the prequels	i really liked all three the phantom menace got alot of bad reviews though
i think it is chic look	definately i love that look
have you listened to their albums	somewhat i know i like gimme fiction and they want my soul especially
did you see the trailer for dunkirk	i am not sure what is it about
do you like rotten tomatoes or meta critic better for movie reviews	i dont know ive used them both in movie research
yes her  i believe she was in some of the fast and furious movies	she was  i think its great casting  shes beautiful and has a natural charisma that you need to play these superheroes
i dont know sometimes i cant bring myself to watch	i know
a 8 string ibanez	sounds fancy
i will agree on that but i just think it might be over	its over when he leaves until then enjoy the ride
how so	there are so many elements that go into it its kind of the height of compositional prowess
in that sense football seems pretty interesting other sports dont have too much meta shift	exactly we should watch a game sometime root for the packers with me
why not take them off the preseason	cause the owners wont let that happen
hes a french	that explains a lot
they are pretty bad	it sounds like the worst
most of them yes except i think the clone wars	who was your favorite character from all the movies combined
she still is  she hasnt faded out of popularity yet	no i guess she hasnt
yep the ancient repositories of knowledge and wisdom	thats so geeky
one of the rare movies where the comic relief friend isnt as funny as the main character	thats true ryan reynolds is hilarious and i love how he pokes fun at himself in the movie
did you like finding nemo	nope its one of my least favorite movies disney has made actually
me too	it probably had a much more organic feel
guess ill just stick with my own playlist then the album doesnt really work so well without them	i know what you mean i mean there are some neat experiments in there but theres not much that really stands out until the end
i know i asked him the same thing	what did he say
yeah it can be overrated to see it on opening day its so crowded	thats what i think too id rather stay away from the crowd
what is your favorite song from the movie	probably i just cant wait to be king
i didnt know joe perry and alice cooper were in a band together	they formed hollywood vampires in 2015 they do a lot of rock song covers
yeah he is a decent piece but they need star power	who wants to come to this team the way that it is presently constructed
i actually stopped watching at half time because i though it was over but then my brother called me back in after the 3rd quarter	well its a good thing you dint miss the fourth quarter
i didnt think that it dragged	yeah well i did but i guess its a matter of opinion
is evil dead any good	yes i love evil dead
i knowits scary	it is a classic
im going cowboys over raiders for the super bowl	that would be a popular game to watch no doubt i think both those teams are going to step back though
it was so sad when they both made it but then vin crashed	but it still had a happy ending so im happy
what is your favorite kind of rock music	i usually like thrash metal the best
yes i recently watched wonder woman and thought it was pretty good as well	i liked that movie also i think its the best dc movie so far
why not	because that stuff is way before my time
they must really hate the patriots there	you got that right
are you watching the game this sunday	yeah for sure im a huge broncos fan
wasnt there a song that had elijah wood on the video	was there  i dont remember
hi	yo
do you know when the new spider man movie comes out	you mean spider man homecoming
the one with ben affleck	yes that movie was insane
your lies is good	which do you like
the godfather and its sequels are great movies  but i prefer romantic comedies	i like them too although i am not a woody allen fan
humph typical disney	yeah well i hope itll have good ratings
if someone you secretly disliked was thinking about becoming a fan of your team how would you describe your team to them so that they didnt want to root for them	if i disliked someone id want them to root for my team so they could suffer too
are you going to see king arthur	i might
like rap god	thats one of the most lyrical songs ive ever heard and he mastered it
the percussionist looked like ronette pulaski	i didnt notice that
its the kind of movie that usually have elements of suspense in it and plays with characters with psychological instability	oh i remember my cousin mentioned blair witch project does that count
samuel l jacson	oh i love his movies too
i am thinking the night showing	what time is that
hey what was the name of red hair girl in the little mermaid	i think her name is arial
gojira is the original japanese name for godzilla their music talks about saving the earth and godzilla or gojira was a force to protect the earth	thats kind of cool are they a good band
no not at all its just good lyrics	would you listen to them still
javier bardem josh brolin tommy lee jones woody harrelson just to name a few	its kind of a western right
have you seen any great movies this year	yes a few my favorite so far has been beauty and the beast
oh sure hes one of my top favorites too when you start thinking about his movies there are just so many amazing iconic films	definitely i go all the way back to close encounters as one of my first all time favorite films
the one thats all about han solo	that scoundrel  cool
cool why dont you come over to my house around 2 pm	great ill bring the popcorn
well i am speaking my mind	well i guess its true
did you know the guys from rage uses that guitar pedal	i did
yes and then he was into spiritualism and meditation	i remember that
that is his choice you dont have to feel bad	i just feel bad because i dont think he ever got the recognition he deserved as a rapper
yeah it was just a little inappropriate too	and there was the simpsons movie
the person i hate the most is kam chancellor	dude is a beast though
but when you say cartoon like that it sounds like youre comparing it to the stuff you see on saturday mornings	yeah i see what you mean
it was an interesting choice to do yoda live with a puppeteer	i think it was brilliant it gave mark hamill a real actor to play off of and it made yoda more real to me
yeah you had to rescue a mermaid and beat up an eskimo with a hammer but its not like the movie wasnt weird	yeah it was an 80s movie richard donner did a good job directing it though
did you enjoy the return of jafar too	i did but it was not as good as the original
all three of those are great	in terms of how i personally favor though ive got to go with andre 3000 from outkast
hi	hey there
lets make a date	sounds like a plan
you mean beetlejuice	oh yeah i always want to say it like the star
well lt sounds like a secure 2 out of three wins	haha yeah
thank god i thought i was the only one	dont worry i think everyone cries when they watch bambi
hey what is up man	nothing much
i think hes only 26 or so	wow i first heard him do a team that seems so long ago
yeah you get it now	i see so it combinatorailly explodes as the number or the rosw increase
whats your favorite movie with him in it	thats a hard one
really man what date are they going to play	july 5th i was thinking about ordering tickets on stubhub
well i think he was still pretty good with them	how many super bowls did he win in total
why seven	the shock when they found bratt pitts wifes head in the box
it attacks her	what happens
agree for me that was one of his best serious films	well yes it dealt with some pretty serious material but in wasnt interiors
yea that would be great since raiders are afc and cowboys are nfc	i would take a miracle for both teams to win their conferences though
he can sing anything and it sounds good	i loved it when he sang play that funky music on the show
yeah its not their greatest but its good to see them still making music	i was just going to say that even if its not that great the old guys still putting out tunes is a relief
i am telling you mate	so that was how you spent your 20 sorry matelol
last night	and how long has it been out for
what is your favorite lady gaga song	thats a tough call new or older lady gaga
whitney houston is corny	no shes not
what thats how baseball exists	i just dont see how thats a stat though you cant control guys getting on ahead of you
if they do win tonight do you think the rockets will win the series	no io think san antonio will win the final game
yeah but i think the point is that the second half are bsides and stuff that was previously unreleased	oh i get it i guess that makes sense
did you like him in return of the jedi	yes but i think they should have killed him off
remember the days when one back got 300 carries a year	sure do that wont happen again with the way teams throw the ball nowadays
the band fun	yeah they were awesome
any standouts that youve watched lately	i saw some good stand up on netflix that count
i like love stories	if you like english accents and love stories this is the movie for you
yeah too much time spent face down looking at the smartphone	have you seen any old school bands performing live recently
interesting i felt la la land had funny moments but i was also in tears in the theater i think the academy tends to award drama more	probably true more drama winners than comedies both were great films win or loose or even if they never got nominated
unfortunately i dont see that happening any time soon	lets hope maybe after this pregnancy
who is your favorite quarterback	tom brady i am a huge fan of his ever since he played for michigan in college
i know i hated scar	that is the saddest part of any movie
it was	are they still making music
do you think the cardinals will be any good this year	they can be pretty good
i believe it was late 2000s	i need to watch it i think i have seen bits and pieces of it
yeah it was a little disjointed did you hear theres a frozen 2 on the way	i hope its not horrible like most disney sequels
what did you think of the latest pirates of the caribbean movie	oh i loved dead men tell no tales i thought it was great
isnt he an actor	yes but also a rapper
i think hes slightly overrated	i agree hes too full of himself these days
theyre really strict about that i dont think you can really watch it for free online nowadays	i pay so much at this rate i might as well just pay to go a couple game a season
yes netflix is definitely worth the money	i agree  i watch it daily
no theyre actually from sweden	cool do they ever play in the us
yeah like miley cyrus i mean her voice is ok but doesnt blow me away	and siawhat is that all about
youre right they definitely just wanted to follow the trend and stay relevant	maybe next year well get better picks
they put on a good show	they sang very well
who do you think the best quarterback is	out of any team
do you know lady gagas music	yes
to tell the truth its probably better i didnt watch it back then i was the type to scare easily and have nightmares i still dont watch scary movies nowadays	but youre comfortable now with jaws
ok so who else	well i like monty python in general and they do a lot of funny songs
why	i think they make fools of themselves and no one but them thinks its great
redbone	yeah i think thats it  i really like that
i guess you are right but at least they could sing	true
i cant wait for thor 3	i know im excited about that
i like the first one slightly better but this one was a good continuation	did they have any cut scenes at the end of the movie that marvel is known for
i think it would have been fine if they didnt rush it	what do you mean
oh yeah i forgot about abu  they will probably have to use some cgi	it wasnt too bad in beauty and the beast maybe they will do a nice job in aladdin
well  i been just hanging around my house doing nothing much	sounds boring
that is awesome maybe they will be able to lose the no fun league moniker	group celebrations using the ball as a prop and going to the ground to celebrate are the things that wont be penalized any more specifically
edgar ramirez	ive heard recently a lot about him how is his performance
i had a lot of his records and played them all the time  rock n roll is the best music ever	it sure is  the music that we could hear the words and the words made sense so unlike what the kids play now  elvis had so many beautiful songs that it is hard to pick my favorite
whats your favorite boston song	more than a feeling is my favorite song from them
otto octavius was a victim of the claws	he was afraid of them
yes that is true too but they also have some new recruits with great potential	like who
hey hows it going	great its good to see you again
me too i like the group celebrations as well	its just like soccer
no i have not that sounds scary	they are a scary band they are very loud
good thing is ther are a young team	yes they are  their fans should have some good football to watch in atlanta for years to come
will i be able to see that on any main television station or do i need a cable or other pay subscription	actually  that game will be broadcast on nbc at 830 eastern standard time
was it as good as the old ones	i do not think so honestly
have you heard about the lousy box office turn out for king arthur the legend of the sword	i heard it was really poor  i wonder if the movies really that bad
at least it is not autotuned	tell me about it
he is the commissioner of the largest sports league in north america so its not surprising	not surprising but the amount hes paid is still outrageous
well there are lots of references to music in his books	i always thought that was just music he liked
so all he wants wick to do is kill his sister	santinos sister not wicks anyway yes thats the deal if santinos sister dies then wick is free
why do you say michael jackson instead of madonna	i think michael jackson had a larger following
i saw imagine dragons in concert yesterday	how was that
yes and those two were great together	did you rent it
i think she is not touring this year but may show in different places briefly	i see i loved her concerts
i guess ben is a boston boy at heart he loves that city	and dont forget about good will hunting
thats sad	i had my emo music though hahaha
i thought you hated the spiderman movies	yes i did because of all the constant reboots
do you think kylo ren can be forgiven for killing han solo	he slayed his father it seems like hes made his choice
last night on abc you can get it on on demand now	oh i will do that this weekend and watch it how was it
it is kind of a sad tale at first	exactly that seen with his mom in the jail when they play baby mine has me in tears
yeah but if you had to pick just one disney movie that is your absolute favorite what would it be	hmm i guess i would have to say alice in wonderland
they really do have a great team i mean look at sydney crocby	that is true as much as i do not care for their team they are very skilled
yeah i think you would some of the music is really 90s girlpunk sounding i love it	awesome sounds like something id like definitely
they did pick up cordarrelle patterson i think thats a great addition	yup carr should pick up right where he left off before his injury last year
what do you mean	you literally watch tom hanks on an island for over an hour and dont get bored
yeah he was a serious crooner in that movie who is carolyn jones	if you remember the original addams family shows well she played as morticia  addams
they are playing anaheim	who do you think will win the stanely cup
totally  and the song i cant get it out of my head	whats the song
i agree why do you like monster i never got that one	i think that it comes off as silly as first but it could be deeper
what about the division overall	what the nfc south yeah well you know youve got a lot of talent maybe too much talent
my ultimate favorite in the marvel genre is xmen	yes rogue is so awesome in that movie
how many songs can you name from the 1980s	hmm lets see well i was a huge cyndi lauper fan so the first song that comes to mind is girls just want to have fun
they have a pretty popular song called awake and alive	hmmm  that does sound familiar
roark was in a similar position and it worked out	yep and some think cole is even more highly regarded than roark was at that time
man that scene in fearless	what scene
youre funny you never want to talk about the actual game	what do you mean i love the game
do they have baby groot	yes but he isnt stuck in his pot anymore he is so cute
kyle chandler too	yeah but i think casey afflecks character was meant to be the centerpiece of the movie
i like both old school and more modern rap but lately ive mostly been listening to more recent rap	oh okay cool is there any reason youre gravitating to more recent rap at the moment
do you like the newer superman movies	they are okay but i think they lost something in the translation
did you see the movie malificent	yes i did angelina jolie was pretty convincing as malificent
and the growing creshendo of voices enthusiatically calling let the game begin	football
yea well sometimes those are harder to find than you may think	i agree hopefully they will find one sooner rather than later though
who do you think will be in the nba finals	definitely golden state
interesting is a good way to describe the movie	is it bizarre
have you been listening to any good pop music lately	yeah i really like ariana grande
i love montreal	theyre good at fighting
well as long as you have brady youll probably still have the best team in the nfl	brady is the goat
agreed kendrick lamar to some is a rapper from the hood but thats super simplistic hes also the best storyteller in the past thirty years	thats a bold claim but i get what youre saying genre labels can limit and define
i mean i guess that makes sense	i just thought it was nice that the stakes were a bit smaller this time around
well yeah but the reality was pretty dramatic anyway there and i bet they took some liberties	im sure they did but not that many i dont think  i just think that actual facts can be just as interesting as some things they do for dramatic license
i dont blame you theres way too much to follow otherwise	what team do you root for
yeah of course ive got several things i want to do before i die	i think all of us probably do im not sure if its quite as fun as in the movie though
i never had the gall to go to cons when he was starringnor did i have the money i did see him in penn station once when he was directing a broadway play and i was too scared to speak with him	wow talk about being starcrossed maybe chewbacca is a little more approachable
he did a song with ekali called dark matter and its amazing	i will check that out i do like the more aggressive stuff sometimes
yes i have a paper due on that subject tomorrow	sounds rough but i can probably help you
yea the nfl	i love it  season ticket holder
they have had a couple during their history  currently it is david gilmour	i am not sure i am familiar with him
does stevie wonder have a lot of albums	yes stevie has a multitude of albums spanning the years
where could i hear him	he actually has a lot of youtube videos that have become really famous one is a cover of a stevie wonder tune dont you worry bout a thing
i dont either  its too gooey	yeah and they dont do the thing with the letters at the end
i know me too it just gets it	i wish we could clone him
its awesome how we just understand from haha	i agree
me too	do you like tim mcgraw
do you like star wars	yes i love those movies
same here brotha i hope your pretty pumped about getting to go to london for the october 1st game	dude you have no idea kinda wish we were playing a better team though
oh are you a fan of metal music	to be honest not really it can be a little overwhelming for me but i admire the skill it takes to play it
want to know a secret	sure
then why would you dress up like a pig in skirt	im not a pig im a hog
hes a very talented guy not just musically it turns out	well i know hes talented musically i love what he does with his voice and the texture of his voice itself
well the only one i knew was glenn close	was she any good
yeah and she writes her songs can play instruments legitimately and doesnt lip sync	her acoustic version of poker face is one of my favorite performances
in star wars lets say that the confederacy wins the clone wars what changes	i dont think they couldve they were designed from the start to lose
i liked her shades	i know i want to steal them for me
those bands are good  they dont make them like that anymore	of course you have nirvana  they were amazing
yeah you can really see how the large professors mentorship helped nas	definitely he helped him craft his lyrics taught him how to edit and to never be satisfied until the lyrics were 100 there
no i didnt but its cool to have an alternative type strong female lead in horror	i agree and her boyfriend was kind of the damsel in distress
music made for video games	how do you listen to that
true  you guys have got a great quarterback in russell wilson	i know i love russell  i was worried that he wasnt going to sign a couple of years ago when his initial contract was up  but he did thank goodness
did you know it takes about 600 cows to make one full season’s worth of nfl footballs	wow thats a lot i guess all that beef gets served during the game
i know the movie interviewed some of the people who got scammed and they lost thousands	what a terrible thing when theyre just trying to chase the american dream
what do you think about the band kiss	theyre not bad  theyve been around for a while huh
can we talk about nani though shes such a lovely character	i know right she looks like an actual human being compared to the rest of disneys animated women
im really looking forward to the new dark tower movie	i dont know much about it
peyton	i like him
what is a song you find underrated	i would say cliffs of dover
yes it is it made me jump off my seat	thats funny i guess ill give it a shot as well
they are one of my favorite bands	thats good
which matchbox 20 song do you like	i like the song 3am
so you believe this will be the outcome to a nfl title	i do see them becoming the new champions and bringing home the trophy to georgia
do you think payless has cheap shoes	yes some are cheap but i worry more about fit that quality
is he a big guy	hes 63
do you see that there are two kinds of keys on the keyboard one kind is white and the other is black	yes i see that but im not sure what significance it has
not yet	you should definitely check it out
yeah they just drafted a 27 year old quarteback named sean renfree	didnt he come from the falcons
we never had a copy of it but i rented it a lot	we had a copy until my mom got so tired of it that she threw it away
i know what you mean	music today does not sound good
still cant believe they got swept	right especially after blowing the save vs the nats right before this series
it is really good	maybe i should get around to watching it
why do you like tupac so much	he lived the way he died
i prefer romantic comedies	i love those movies must love dogs is my favorite
not it seems like you can just shazaam something at it will come up	that helps with music

me too	and the actors in comedy movies are great
they are really good	yeah i cant believe they were at the grammys this year
do you think we will ever get back to real country	not as long as the pop country is popular
well thicker more comfortable seats for starters	so the baseball seats were better than the football seats
quick whats your favorite theme song ever	theres so many my favorite is the friends theme song ill be there with you
we talked about our favorite musicians in the 1960s	that was a great decade for music who were your favorites
when did beauty and the beast come out	1991
what other song on that album do you like	feels like the first time is good and on that album
he typically always delivers  but the direction of this is on a whole other level i am of course a boxing fan so perhaps biased	you do love your boxing get back to me soon and we can make this work
they had a lot of featured guests on that album	i believe it was every song having at least one guest spot
so did you hear what bradys wife said a few weeks back	about the concussions
when hercules finally became a god and defeated hades it was such a powerful moment	i loved the training montage scenes  danny devito as phil was hilarious
darth vadar was evil and uncaring in the original movies the new ones just dont have that element	i have always admired the original movies and how they did the space craft using model toys
i am a bryan adams fan	really  what songs do you like best of his

hitchhikers guide to the galaxy	really what was he in that
what is your favorite rock band	i am currently loving fozzy
yea the nfl	sure do
who	handel  besides messiah its just boring
they do have a very good defense	the panthers have a lot of talent but i do not see them getting too far
i agree  that one song where he sings like he is a gun is brillant	ilmatic is still his best albulm
those are more like mysteries or suspense movies i tend to like psychological thrillers like saw seven and the shining	yes i like movies that make you think
i wonder who will be in the next superbowl	maybe the new york jets
i like all of them too it sucks i havent heard any new songs from them	i know i wish they would come out with more music yea especially eminem hes a classic
hey fellow zombie	hi you like the pretty reckless too
what other musicians are you in to	i love 50 cent he is a legend in my mind

the lions i believe the browns before that	the browns now youre just purposefully trying to offend me
tell me about it  just pure awesome rock	i really liked dream on
what was the name of that movie with nic cage and john travolta	face off
do you mean when the dwarf picks up the picture and it plays that pop song	yeah it seemed out of place
oh thats too bad you should find some on youtube	maybe i will i loved the battle scene at the end of the movie though love conquers all
not only with music but its fun to remember the older movies too	i agree  the special effects in the older movies make me laugh
kidding i know about the controversy	have you seen moonlight
ill be honest i dont remember much about that movie	its the movie about the family with superpowers
when he smashed that homer and ran the bases jace peterson and kurt suzuki both said something to him	and then on thursday teheran was trying to nail bautista on the plate
well you should get a rotten tomatoes account	i have one but people would just think im crazy or ranting
that is cool	it is they have a great team
reese witherspoons character would probably say the same	you can be a mom and a person home again seems to explore that idea
i think theyre doing a sequel	great why cant they leave well enough alone
well that doesnt prove anything	if you put that with him going to learn about more religion in india it adds up
why	the language and content is not something i prefer
who would you call the original mc	i am not sure their is so many to choose from
freddie mercury is the bet singer of all time	yeah thats why the have so many hits
it was on the billboard chart for over fourteen years	wow thats unbelievable
oh buddy why so glum	well i was a colts fan but mostly because i was such a big supporter of what peyton manning did for that team year after year
been keeping up with their players lately	been keeping up with their cheerleaders mostly but did hear a couple players had some issues this past week
hey did you see guardians of the galaxy 2 yet	yeah i saw it last weekend with my sister

did you ever see on the waterfront	was that the one with marlon brando
me too but i dont really know a lot about them	they are a british band who formed in the 80s
thats too bad i wanted to take you to her concert	i will pass
i think the rest of the league will loosen up once brady and belichick are gone	which with any luck will be very soon
yea i agree but did he show any signs of getting old	no not really he was still really good
did you see all the 3 movies	of course i did i still think the first one was the best one
that sounds really good is it a recent film	kind of i think it came out in the last fifteen years or so i cant remember
with celine she can be very blunt and to the point	i think shes a great vocalist though
have you seen green room	yes it is so good
oh thats a good choice i loved tate donovan as his voice actor	another one is probably aladdin
he really is	i love any movie with him in it
they definitely have	maybe the fact that their new music sounds so similar created a lot of desire for it
action in the sense that the character wasnt just talking but they showed how to pray	were they doing a lot of praying
what do you think of sabaton	sabaton who are they
yes that would be the one	i think its great that its so positive towards the lgbtq community
so do i	did you see constatine
same here did you watch get a job bryan cranston has a roll in that movie too	yes i love that movie anna kendrick and miles teller were great together and bryan cranston played a believable father role
ill have to check it out any other good ones	king arthur was pretty good
what a shame he had a bright future how about good fellas	that was really good with ray liotta
i really liked the songs they used in the trailers	yeah me too my favorite was the one by fleetwood mac
you mean like raising money for school kids but still in the biker life	yes exactly
yup and theres already been a bunch of references to it already	i guess its a big deal
didnt you see the 2017 live action version	they remade beauty and the beast how could they
they did one of them went to 1 on the charts	thats amazing i had no idea his solo career was so successful
im jealous you already saw it gal gadot looks like she plays a great wonderwoman	oh man she did a fanstastic job her acting was beyond excellent
i like it though	good thing
which did you like the move	i actually liked the first one the most
do you like gospel music	yes i do i listen to all music except heavy metal
i know but he went and played for the rival vikings	you do what you got to do
but not aesthetically like	yeah
me too my entire family loves them	the miami dolphins are interesting too however
i will miss him	he really was the best captain america
i enjoy music alot	me too
what makes you hate it so much	the storyline really in that day a mom like that would have been seen as a woman of loose morals and to get involved would have cost that guy business
guy pearce was brilliant	he is an exceptional actor
i am sure there are some great scandalous stories	madonna does seem wild at least in her younger years
yes that was a great movie	i agree
theres a lot of classic music but its all incredibly epic not your classical music at a picnic with your grandparents	classical music doesnt need words to say what it wants to say
you know greedo shot first right	of course i know that everybody knows that
oh seriously	yes i know i like as long as you love me
in it they try to explain why the transformers keep coming to earth	because they are gluttons for punishment enough said
ive seen a few snoop dogg videos maybe heard some tupac maybe a jayz song or something	but nothing really stuck with you

nfl supplemental draft	like anything is going to happen there were a total of zero picks last year
yes youre right the movie follows his life pretty closely	is he the writer on the movie
sure im a huge fan  80s music was the best	i agree with you there  whats your favorite billy idol song
so have you seen any new movies lately	well i havent really been out to the movies in a while
at least it isnt a complete remake	you dont like remakes
a new hope was released in 1977	have they released all of the movies in the series
it shows the story of three servicemen returning from the war	yeah who is in it
maybe i loved andy reid but it was time for him to go too many post seasons ending too soon	i liked him too but i was ok with the decision for something new but chip kelly was not a good fit
well he is a funny charactor but i think it was more like they were wanting to make a comedy rather than a star wars movie with funny han moments	i guess that makes sense i just hope they do better with this spinoff than they did with rouge one
i just watched the shining made in 1980 have you seen it before	oh yes i have move than once
then lucas would have been establishing that the action was taking place in a universe of different laws which would have been fine	so establishing place first can make a book or movie science fiction not establishing place can make it fantasy
yeah soundgarden were	yup
boring	true how bout you
i mean he does not play in movies that much anymore	he does a little though even if it is not much
the harmonies in that are excellent	yes thats what i love about the song
thats so cool ill have to do something like that in the future	enough about the past though what do you think of their newer albums
i dont know i mean there are lot of great techno bands out there	so you mean linkin park cant compete them
okay and four	i gotta include callin baton rogue
thats true  they are truly the underdogs and when they finally do win the super bowl or even get to go its going to be epic	i dont see that ever happening it might but i wouldnt get your hopes up
do you know blind melon	im not sure
what album are you currently listening to	coincidentally exodus
i enjoy her music especially her recent hit work	i still get  umbrella tuck in my head all the time
i know maybe ill give them a try	i am pretty sure you will find what you are looking for
i wonder if they can keep it all going still	i think so
what did you think about tony starks choice to attack without his suit in the third movie	i thought he was crazy
oh yeah i like that song too  didnt they both sing with ariana grande	yup all three got together on stage with bang bang
not that  but it is pretty clear when a sex scene is on because they dont really hide any of the movement going on	wouldnt it be great if we could filter crap like that and just enjoy the movie
salmon dance is one of the best remixes ever made	i love that track and miss the old times this show will be for nostalgias sake
its gospel but it has a modern spin on it	modern like how
why	his peers reported that he was the most difficult to tackle
yeah i think they have a special if you buy 2 you get the second one cheaper	really ok cool movie day sunday
yes i could see why it wasent amazing but it was a good thriller with a bit of action thrown in	interesting ben seems to be doing some good movies lately so i should probabally give the accountant a try
sure itunes has it all	hmm good i think ill look em up
its such a unifying sport	the action and excitement just radiate throughout my body when i watch it
what kind of music turns you on ma man	i listen to jazz free form
imagine being in prison for over 50 and havign to adjust to normal life again	no i definitely couldnt
oh wow what happened	as i was walking in to the theater somebody said the ending to one of their friends
well spiderman is peter parker for one and he gets bitten by a spider in a laboratory that had been kept in there to run tests on	alright sounds cool so far
i like comedy alot	like what movies
there are too many	realy
yes	you normally harmonize in thirds based on the circle of fifths yes
if only they would have left it alone or actually made sequels that made sense	i dont hate all of the sequels but i do agree they were not on par with the original
so she wrote that song for him	yes she recorded it back in 1973
i have two reservations there	oh what are they
yes it is on at six so lets get ready to watch it	i dont watch movies too often but this one is one ive liked since childhood
you will enjoy it	ok i will watch it thanks for mentioning it
yes	i have  i saw it last week
do you know who imagine dragons are	i am not sure can you tell me one of their songs
wow i wouldnt expect that from willis	yea it was his night on the glass
he was good but i preferred stephen baldwin	mcmanus was a good character but spaceys acting blows his out of the water
what ever happened to lorde	i dont know but i saw her on a tv interview a couple weeks ago
i read about the one in seattle which was 200 million	most of the time they are empty
i guess	what kind of music do you like
who is going to win it all	i think the patriots i know lol a boring guess
i think senators and preds	i like the senators too but the star power is going to be too much for them to handle
ive heard of them but i cant remember any of their songs	oh they had a few
i like rb too who is your favorite singer or group	mary j blige is my favorite rb singer i like her and lauryn hill
i dont think its that bad of a genre there are some irritable artists though	i dont think its that bad of a genre there are some irritable artists
she reminds me of my mom i know that sounds bad they just sound alike	oh i kinda thought the same thing
they just need coaches with more vision	im sure that someone will come along that knows what theyre doing
my vote is for black widow  she doesnt have any powers either and not even bow	i always like to identify actors by the roles theyve played in superhero movies
think theyll make a super girl movie	i wonder
so where would you rank this one among his movies	it was closer to the top but not his best i would put it at his third best below incendies and above enemy
and the hat heard him	so he got put in griffindor
it is a good movie	who plays in the movie
fun fun fun good vibrations kokomo and help me rhonda	you might want to add california girls and surfin safari
yeah their pretty good every year i dont know how those fans sit outside in that frozen tundra	its tough but we love it who do you think will win it all this year
his vocals were so strong	he could do so much with his voice
we probably wont play them this year carolina is getting better	another running quarterback
like when kanye put out yeezus that album came out of nowhere and was brilliant from the first second	yes exactly like that the textures on that album are so raw and dark it wasnt exactly radio friendly either
i think one thriller that is slightly underrated is the butterfly effect with ashton kutcher from 2004 have you seen it	i have not seen that honestly ashton kutcher doing a thriller movie really
what did you think about the new star wars movie	you mean rogue one
oh i love that one	yeah it is my favorite of all time
why is that	i prefer arnold as a bad guy it was cool to see him not as the hero
i guess but  no im saying that jedi are just pumping out this heavy aura of energy on a cellular level that if trained can do all kinds of wacky stuff	okay so i guess thats kind of reconciling the episode one business with the original explanation then
i guess so well groups that are still making music today	i like iron and wine a lot
cool	yeah
like the breakfast club	stuff happens they go to detention and then leave detention
i told you a woman and her car	but what else
yeah i guess it is  you really need to see the video	i kind of want to now
the concept of the movie had me sold from the start and when i heard heather was back i knew i had to check this out back then	i think heather was last scene in dream warriors the third nightmare on elm street which was probably the last one of that was decent and a lot of fans really have that as their favorite
what teams will have the strongest defenses in 2017 in the nfl	i think the bengals will stay stout and the patriots will be strong you
no do you recommend anything	yes buy soundgardens cds badmotorfinger superunknown and down on the upside  you will hear some awesome music
possibly i guess	nah for real it is
well harry over comes things	he still stays fairly true to himself too
the 2017 nfl season is about to start	i have heard that and i am excited
yeah i know how that feels i am a sabres fan	oh well you guys keep looking better lots of good prospects

thats a great deal do you always get your shoes from ross	no i just saw that these were on sale so i took advantage
man i think this movie is rad	what movie
i love the whole plot	and it is especially since pocahontas is a revelry indian princess
san diego	who scored first
so is tarantino i mean hes not a great actor but it was good for him	hes supposedly doing a kill bill 3
well if you stay until all the credits run theres a scene that is a perfect leadin to another movie most people wont know it even exists if they take off before the credits are done	cool ill be sure to stay and see it
well i cant help you there i mostly know him from his singles	which one is your favourite
i dont feel that way to be honest with you	what was the best parts of it then
all the characters were so creatively designed	yeah every time i see it i appreciate something new about the characters aesthetics and eccentricities
huh what do you know	but they are getting younger on the average
really	yes really
alright how about the dc universe	there is batman superman batman vs superman the green lantern and i think they are coming out with an aquaman and wonder woman just came out
i am thinking this movie was by wes craven correct	nope this one was done by stephen king without question one of his most famous works ever
yes when the room was dark and then all of a sudden a red lightsaber slowly appears	that was the darth vader that we deserve

have you seen the movie life	is that the space movie with the alien
it was so over the top that it was actually great they took romance to a new level	romance they took bromance to another level
2007 i believe	okay so they met there and what next
yes	the two robots walk around in the desert and darth vader is introduced
yes i am	alright eli all the way
i hope disney has a new movie coming out soon im sick of watching moana with my little one	i dont know when their next film comes out but i know they just finished filming a mary poppins reboot
they both have pop songs written about them	that must mean you made it in the music world
yeah and put the saber in his eye	then vader would never have killed him
i hope they dont all end up straight to dvd	like most of the american pie films
but then he eventually falls off	well jumps off yes

thats probably for the best	how are you going to watch rogue one and the force awakens with the others

im sure if they made a sequel it wouldnt be bad at all	heres to hoping samuel l jackson gets some more voice acting work with pixar

load and reload are awful	no way

wow  did they play all the hits	yeah most of them i didnt get to hear my favorite song though
what is your favorite song from smashing pumpkins	1979
ledgers performance was obviously important but that just goes to further prove my point	well he was the main criminal granted but without the costumes capes and gadgets i think it would have been far less successful
i like the nba myself better skill on show	i get that but i think college means more

every little thing has had over a million hits on you tube	that is amazing she must be great in that video
any other directors i might know	you might have heard of the duplass brothers mark duplass was on the television show the league and jay duplass is on transparent

pre1986 movies are old old movie	theyre not old old maybe just normally old

the way travis does in taxi driver	crazy the movie has some other great characters as well albert brooks peter boyle

hes a tough one to beat	who even comes close
i heard that the shining is based on a book is that true	yes its based on a novel by stephen king however the film is very different from the book
thats true it would be great to see them make a run for american league title	or even the world series
i guess he could	what about the drummer they had before ringo pete somebody i think
in 1977	makes me feel old
that was a good one too but those two sounded almost like the same song to me	i used to blast the radio and sing along with those songs when i was in high school

the plans for the concert tonight	oh that
well now that you say that i can see it	do you like the newer movies
i really enjoyed that the heroine of this disney movie wasnt technically a princess for once	i liked that too the humor was also perfectly timed

which sounds better	they sound the same the only real differences are appearance and that rotary springs back faster but its not noticeable really
i loved the accent he had as mrs doubtfire	yes it sounded so funny when mrs doubtfire was explaining how her husband was killed
well she does have commercial value i just dont know if her music can really be called great	well music tastes are always subjective but i bet everyone can sing along to her music
hey so you think the falcons will be able to make it back to the super bowl	no in fact i dont think theyll win the nfc south this year

he tried from what i understand spielberg convinced him to do it	that was a mistake
papa roach	they sort of always been bad
you should go next year i heard de la soul and the pharcyde were jealous and wanted to do a back to back set	sick man they should get the jungle brothers and a tribe called quest again and really throw an amazing show
he was so talented its not a surprise he was successful	i know he was successful for decades
as long as kawhi comes back and can play defense and aldridge can have a solid game i think we have a good shot	cleveland may also be a nuissance to them before the warriors
and the winner will face houston in the 2017 world series	i think the rockies will play the baltimore orioles in the 2017 world series
like what	like olympus has fallen and white house down or the illusionist and the prestige

like how	some songs are funky circus music and have heavy metal portions
it could be how did you like mandy moore in that role	i thought she was awesome ive always liked her as a singer and actress though

motion was released by him in  2014	what label was it under

i know thats kind of the point of the movie actually	what that its boring
do you think michael jackson is the king of pop	i think he is the king of pop no doubt
well if you want a nonstandard war film try 1941 now thats an underrated movie	if were talking about underrated spielberg films then the most underrated has to go to the terminal

heck yeah	man this going to be a pretty good game
i know i do that all the time	yeah you just sing the words you believe sound right but dont really know the lyrics
irvin kershner	right  who plays yoda
i guess that they could become more dominant under the direction of wade phillips i just dont see a strong defensive secondary yet	im not overly concerned about that wade phillips does a great job of getting the most out of his defensive secondaries
oh thats a good one	i know thats why i chose that one
i dont think every film is going to appeal to every person so you hated it someone else loved it	i am sure they did many even i just find disney films  i do enjoy most are the animated features
did you ever listen to boy bands	yea every now and then
yeah but even so  im glad they kept making them	have you heard anything about a new one coming out
in pother words lets say you have a row and now you want to start a new row then you can transform it and then start the new row with any note you would like	as long as no single note is repeated

why do you think that is	the rules regarding pass interferece
they are definitely hoping for the player who caught 24 touchdowns his last two years in denver	yes he did that in an offense led by adam gase just like he has in miami

it is but the setting and the accents and the whole vibe is really great	isnt matt damon in it
that is a good reason do you have nfl sunday ticket from direct tv	no what is that

that album is incredibly under rated it ushered in a new era of pop and hip hop music	you may be kind of right but not every song on that album was great

id like to see some new teams get there	i dont know look at the last two new teams panthers and falcons panthers were awful and falcons were worse
right there seems to have been a point when everyone got very serious too serious	but there was serious stuff in the past the message by grandmaster flash came out in the early 80s for example
interesting choice	i just dont think the film was that great to be honest
no it was green bay against dallas to see who was going to go to the first superbowl	thats right and gb went on to beat the colts
so which one do you think is best	i really loved rubber soul but no one else seems to

yea well if carr stays healthy they are a superbowl contender	i agree but that seems to be a big if with him
i agree not many bands have their kind of longevity	everyone in the group still performs so well
yes carolina did not have any answer for them either way	okay i guess this is just a down year for the carolina panthers then
so its that its early and he will rebound	i do think so hes also been in the league exactly long enough that the league knows his profile as a hitter now and are exploiting any weaknesses he may have

any other movies that you like	i loved casper
i agree jared poche pitched really good yesterday	poche is going to need to be on his a game today though

well i was wondering something	go ahead
he was such an amazing artist	its so sad he had to die the way he did
yeah	she also took uncle bens death welll
beautiful to look at and extremely emotionally nuanced with no black and white characters	do similar movies  particularly animated ones  exist in hollywood

yes he is completely country and is very good	yes i remember him he sand dirt road as well right
yea i can see where youre coming from the story isnt great	the story is bad and the characters are dull
it should just about any music with a beat that you or i enjoy is a result of cultural appropriation we took their bodies their labor their wealth their dignity  and finally their culture that they use to cope with all of our abuse	man i uh
have you ever bet on the nfl	yeah a bunch of times
have you seen walle	yes i have
like less than 1 of the population is born with some of their senses intertwined	wow i wish i had that
well you have a a slower song like never going back again immediately followed by the more up tempo dont stop	i love that aspect of the album it shows the complexity and mixed emotions of the band that was experiencing numerous breakups while recording the album
i love music	me too
do you play fantasy football	yeah my buddies and i have a league  you play
furthermore it pulls together an allstar cast and gives them opportunities to live up to their voice acting potential	i noticed that pun you put in with all star
isiah johnson is returning this season as well	right on he was another poins earner from last season

yeah and bowie was an absolute chameleon that guy changed his style and aesthetic so many times	plastic soul honky tonk punk rocknroll postpunk electronic jazz

im good at making baskets but i need to be more aggressive	whys that
baltimore is always a wild card for me they were only one game from the division title last year and the core is returning so they are contenders	yeah ill give you that but cincy is finished if you ask me

goodness i started listening to them back in 1990 not sure if they have been around longer then that	im surprised that ive never heard of them
i agree i had a chance to listen to our whole album and a lot of the songs on there really fun and made you want to dance	i heard lady gaga alive on the howard stern show she sounded great

whats a fugue	thats when you take a short idea like one or two measures long and subject it to a ton of crazy counterpoint

i would also say that bill belichick deserves a lot of credit as well he kept them in that game	he didnt just keep them in that game he motivated them to not quit and gave them a playbook for the turnaround

did you like good charlotte	yes
hey did you watch the super bowl	i sure did how does atlanta blow a 283 lead

and comics too  theyre music is great	is it all funny
it sure was entertaining i coudnt believe i loved watching it so much	yes that and finding dory were both awesome
that was pretty good yeah	which was the one with the racist sign that he had to wear

me either	what about the hunger games

makes sense why they took tom cruise	ha ha ha are you suggesting that tom cruise is symbolic of action movies
do you like thriller movies	yes i do
they do bring me back to those years but i dont associate them with that the good things that happened during that time in my life	what song do you hate the most from the offspring
it wasnt that bad of a movie	but the special effects are great

the ending was though	it was
do you know of rage against the machine	yes i do and i find them to be an amazing band that just makes me feel so cool when i am listening to them

oh like youre any better how many times have you seen the underworld series	i hardly see how thats relevant
what is your favorite star wars movie	well i watched a bunch of the older ones over and over again on vhs when i was a kid so those tend to be the ones im most familiar with
this one is just too hard to believe no network footage exists of super bowl i it was reportedly taped over for a soap opera according to some rumors	oh man do you know what that would be worth if it actually existed
well i like it when it first started	dont get autotune and vocoders confused  both are used all of the time in pop music
which song	ill take your man

i am pretty certain i would but i dont know for sure	do you remember where the hunger games took place
i havent heard it	check that out and sampha
i always look forward to the nfl super bowl every year	yes its like a holiday it doesnt matter which teams play
yes he has	i believe he had more hits in the seventies than any other exbeatle had after the breakup
yeah i liked the seeing all the animals some didnt look like what i expected but i thought the first movie harry potter and sorcerers stone was one of the best	thats because it was the first setting you up for series
yeah i do  do you like it	yeah sure do  do you have a team
thats cool i liked them	its great music i love paying it every night it took me 5 years to master stairway to heaven
rolling down a river	whats love got to do with it and the movie was about ike turner and how he treated tina turner

who was in that movie	ben winchell was the main character
hey i just got done watching peter pan	oh i remember that movie why did you just watch it
wow that sounds like a whos who of 80s stars is it all comedy or is it scary too	its pretty much a farce but its amazing i have seen it over 20 times i can quote most of it

yeah its pretty good he collaborated with a lot of different artists like gerard way and patrick stump	sounds interesting is black veil brides breaking up
i agree the coach is crucial to the team there have been some great ones over the years like bill walsh chuck knoll and don shula	i love watching these kinds of coaches become commentators once they retire their perspective is so insightful

if you are going to try them i suggest listening to master of puppets	i will keep that in mind  do they have other good songs

yeah that was were i think the whole beef might i sprang from	funny though they both do different kind of musicweekend rnb and wizkid afropop so dont see why the competition

so what do you think about that deforest buckner seems like theres a lot of hype around him lately	and with good reason dude is going to be a defensive mvp this year for certain

thats funny huh	its music man
i cant believe that theyre great	i saw the one about the fish and didnt really care for it
yes thats him	i love jason bateman i didnt know he was in a movie with aniston and miller

the smell of fresh cut grass and a wide open field quietly waiting for the violence of the day	now youve lost me
i thought it was a little corny but i didnt really mind it i liked lindsay in there too	she did a good job michael keaton was her father remember overall it was fun but not one of those legendary memorial disney films

dakota johnson plays miss anastasia steele	isnt the movie quite racy

what about techno	ok you got me there i think thats pretty awful
hey the nfl season will be coming up soon	yes i know and im pretty excited
true in previous years they didnt have to worry about harrison barnes offensively but durant is one of the best in the league	im more interested in the kyrie irving and stephen curry matchup again

alright ill go rent a dvd of the first movie	can i watch it with you i really like that movie
who plays in it	vince vaughn kristen bell jon favreau and quite a few more
i think that song spans generations	oh it is definitely a huge track
i think so too im more of a beatles fan personally	i think they had a couple of very good songs but i just cant get into them that much
i will probably wait until it comes out on netflix	we love that netflix carries several of disneys movies
definitely tom hanks played a great part	yea there were a lot of good actors in that one too
no kidding thats cool what are the other two	well out of the newer ones i thought inside out was fantastic

on top of that there are actually some great actors in it too	oh yeah like who
it is based on the novel by alan glynn	it must be a great story if they made it into a movie
there was absolutely nothing in the previous movies to support any of that movies that just make up something out of left field to surprise people with no foreshadowing drive me crazy	it wasnt just that there was no foreshadowing to suggest any of it marvel had gone out of its way to lead us into thinking something totally different
man why is it all the good ones die young	seriously what kind of freak must his dad have been to shoot his own sonsick puppy
okay we did toby keith so lets do top five favorite garth brooks song now	finding five good songs is gonna be easy figuring out the five best songs is gonna be the issue

yeah i went see maroon 5  they have a lot of hits and i thought it would be a good show	was it a good show  they sounds like theyd be good in person

yes she was good in that arrival also stars jeremy renner forest whitaker and tzi ma	wow that is a great cast
typical shark movie	just a little bit mandy moore did great but the story line was just a little off

yup she has a really good voice i think you will have fun	if i go to the concert you can buy my ticket i am not paying money to attend a pop concert
is the movie scary i might watch it with my wife	its not that scary just very tense and suspenseful
it is a great story i highly recommend it	i will have to look into watching it

thats the first song i ever heard of his	really its a good one
do you have memories attached to them	uh being sad and alone in my dorm room
cant say that i have	hes really good you can get his three mixtapes for free and he just dropped an album
not just that there is way more he was not as mean to harrys other pals at least not as mean as he was to neville	then why
mine is home alone tonight	the one that he sings with the girl from little big town
its simple music for simple people	simple doesnt mean good
most of them have horror themes and the songs often tell a story but its usually vague and out of order	i like horror but i like scifi more do they have anything like that
he is funny but creepy at the same time	i agree he is a weird creature
they must be ready for a great season	they sure pump up the spirit

i also like voices	the vocals on that are amazing
i am planning on renting a marathon of superhero movies	what sort of movies
great i will add him to the mix tape	reba also sings quite a few hymns
i think that youre right about the offseason additions but im more worried about if they can shake that superbowl loss	it would definately be a tough thing to go through losing a 25 point lead late in the game but i think enough time will have passed
what was the best lightsaber battle of the whole star wars franchise	as much as i disliked phantom menace i loved the battle where quigon and obiwan face off against darth maul
it was amazing one of the scariest concepts to me the last scene images stayed with me a while creepy to say the least	i had read the stephen king loved this film and felt it was truly horrifying as well
since everything is discussed in the board room the vision of the company is probably always prioritized	so football is the socialist guy among other pro sports

mandy moore and claire holt are in it chris johnson and matthew modine as well	how many stars did it get for reviews

really tell me a few of your favorite artists and ill tell you mine	well im a big fan of the red hot chili peppers popevil three doors down and breaking benjamin
yeah the kind of bulbous ocarinas that you hold sideways	like in the game right
my favorite is their song called sadeness i think it was one of those songs that were one hit wonders	im going to have to check them out on spotify later they sound interesting
i think the giants could be a strong playoff contender	possibly they do have a great defense
remember any of the names of the songs	under the sea kiss the girlsome others i cant think of right now
not only scenes and ideas but also costumes that mimicked japanese clothing	wow so the credit for the ideas goes to a lot of other people
yes i think even for people that are a fan of the original it would be better to watch it with no expectations	i think ill probably watch it then
what do they call that kind of dreamy music	i think that its called electro pop dance ive even heard it called glam because of the makeup and outfits that they wear
i have heard you play and sing and you are bursting with musicall talent	music takes me to a wonderful place in my soul that i dont never want to come back from
yes actually my favorite album is reroute to remain	mine too i cannot believe we have that in common
me too what you think about his song sunshine	its fantastic
that is a good choice this movie is really well done a masterpiece	ok thank you for the recommendation
yeah so many movies have made a joke of it  but that snappy camera work and suspense is unparalleled to this day	it was  today is often all special effects and no true suspense anymore
i really like the character yondu udonta who is your favorite character	i really love the main character starlord the character is so funny and i enjoy watching the actor play him
do you remember the 2000 seattle seahawks	boy what a team they finished 6–10 that year
i loved unchained melody	very powerful song
did you like the movie et	yeah i liked it as a kid and liked it when i saw it recently
hey do you like movies	anyhting specific or just movies ingeneral
i like the abbey road album	i think that is the best album that the beatles made
yeah the qb is good what was his name	marcus mariota
james macarthur	cool  the original dano
have you heard the kings of leon music	yea i did not really like it
right it felt good to have an awesome character like rey and i adored seeing that princess leia had become a general of all things	yes the movie really highlighted the multiple facets of women without being preachy i loved that movie
oh most definitely	hakuna matata is one of my all time favorite feelgood songs
i loved it it was very funny and entertaining	i might go buy that one tomorrow and have a movie night
they are an american punk rock band formed in 1986	that is cool i am sure i know their songs
they got deshaun watson though didnt they	yes but just because he was strong in college doesnt mean that translates to the nfl
i think they sang calling you on the tonight show when jay leno was hosting	no they sang hate me then i remeber watching that episode
aaron rodgers is really great too	hes coming up on 300 touchdowns
oh i love that mine is finding nemo	honestly all pixar movies are classics
what do they need rest for	for injuries they get while playing
nothing really been pretty relaxed tonight	sounds good
the birds had a much deeper meaning then i think people realize	i heard its really about the end of the world
did you watch the yankees game	yes it was a good game
the title is after laughter	what does it sound like
has to be better all of the prequels	the first two prequels were a total disaster the third was solid but still far more full of cheese and cgi than the force awakens
yeah and after you listen to that album you can head to his older stuff which is also good	which one should i pick up
yes thats right its a good one too	i think i might like this genre
ha	they just shouldnt make any more sequels
another perfect choice	gene hackman as lex luther and margot kidder were both great too
right but you cant take sirius with you wherever you go	do artists get paid alot from those music apps
sure he is a caucasian guy with red hair and sings different popular songs like shape of you	oh i think i have heard of him actually
then try listening to bruno mars	okay let me hear a song i have not heard yet from him
yes	no i think we will see remakes until one flops
yep thats right	ive only seen that once but i remember it really blew me away
mine is the sheer power of moving things that count dooku has	yeah its pretty impressive that he was able to move things easier than yoda
me either didnt he just direct sully	yep thats right
in the nfl	oh the denver broncos
because it is star wars  you are born loving it	youre right  i liked empire strikes back
higher was an anthem for awhile you have to admit it was catchy at first	i think the singer wanted to sound like pearl jam too much
how will you know if its a waste of money if he hasnt even played yet	its an accounting and management issue hes a controllable asset and you dont want to start his service clock where he becomes more expensive unless he can contribute
you have to listen to wings its perfection	ha ha youre really passionate about these guys
timeconsuming but so much fun	who is your favorite bond
it kind of mocks the country club thing really well done	and that is funny
yeah that was a classic	okay im sold lets go see the kong movie
i think they could use him now	i think he could be too young and could get hurt like the other players
it is next tuesday	perfect i am off that night

well harry was fighting without saying his spells out loud	why does that matter
wow she was very young	yes she has been a very successful singer since then
yes she does	does she get the bike
whats some music youve been listening to lately	i like twenty one pilots
so which one do you like more aliens or predators	i like predators more i love their use of technological weapons especially their cloaking ability
what do you like about those movies	oh well evil dead 2 is one of the few movies ive ever seen that could combine horror and comedy os successfully without being too ridiculous
the eagles	theyre mediocre
i am pretty sure theyre first game is a home game in september	yes they play the cleveland browns at home
kind of but then they just erased the whole plot of the old ones	but it did move the story on
so true pretty soon robots will just take their place	it kind of feels like thats already happened
are you a soprano	yes songs that haver higher octaves are better for me my current favorite is lauries song
what are some of the different animals used as mascots in the nfl	there is a raven a tiger and a horse for a few examples
thats salman rushdie	ah yes almost the same thing probably
yes it is a good movie just not as good	was it worth it to see it in 3d
carson palmer has been playing nfl football for 15 seasons hes running out of time	he could have a few more good seasons if he can stay healthy just look at tom brady
yes it is its a much different take on your typical marvel movie or just superhero movie in general though	okay im interested what else
thats true	its amazing
same here i wish they could make another great film like star wars	me too it is such a cool idea
can you give me an example	yes the born this way album is all about the celebration of diversity
well if that is the best you can do i feel sorry for you ill make it up to you by bringing the barbque sauce to the next game	the only ribs youll be seeing will be your own
yes he was the great terrence malick directed that and the haunting narrations and montages are usually his style i think sean penn took some inspiration from that for the last face	it just didnt work for you
that sounds lovely	the beatles music is very special to us as a couple
ray of light and swim are my favorite songs on that album	nothing really matters is the best on that one i enjoy
definitely	the bad part is rich people live for ever
what do you think about country music	i could give or take it not a huge fan but i dont hate it
ares says that even though he has given humans their destructive desires that its really they who are responsible since they are the ones with free will and are performing the actual violent acts	ahhh so dianas the hero whos going to save humanity from themselves
check out personal shopper its a horror crime mystery all locked in with kristen stewart giving a pretty powerful performance its very suspenseful and tense and its actually from the same director as clouds of sils maria	olivier assayas thats the director i love his style its very cinematic and slowly paced so you get a chance to absorb the scenes and whats happening around the movie i didnt know he directed personal shopper ill have to give it a watch
the teenage dream album	thats the one     anyone do that it the past
sounds good which songs are you adding	i am going to listen to some classic rock and roll it always motivates me
that is awesome to here i saw some recent horror movies on netflix but they werent that good	i get you i watch horror movies on those streaming sites and none of them do the job

its tom cruise and emily blunt dying every day to learn how to defeat aliens who can reset time	thats what its called
i only got to see about the first 20 minutes before i got a call to going to work	wow that really stinks how did you least like the first 20 minutes

for me id probably go with the departed	thats a pretty solid choice  id go with wolf of wall street
yeah they rap that southern rap	yeah and they some of the best down south
not really theres some story lines to it but for the most part its another action packed movie	is it over the top action packed or just a normal action packed movie
i see now	whats yours
dolphins	more like doofus
it really was i never saw the twist coming even though i feel like i should have	the whole atmosphere of that movie was incredible
yes	of course theyre the bomb
yes i loved death of a bachelor	i agree what a great album
yo you see that movie snow white	that really old one

yes dont be stupid	give me an example then
what was your favorite song from that movie	i like the song emma stone sings during the audition
what team do you think is going to be the biggest challenge in the division	it always seems to be the packers by the time its all said and done
mine go just for the food and mascots	i know  i think theyll eventually like football though

is there a reason that one is your favorite	well it has drive my car and norwegian wood which are two of my favorite beatles songs
i like bts a lot	i like suga
well one of the most interesting clues is a piece of candy which jackson sees on the floor during a casual conversation	a piece of candy feels like a bit of a stretch
eh so he wasnt able to make all the plays	not all of them  he actually lost his shoe in the mud once
yeah that does show off some of the special skills the players have	i think it helps attract fans who maybe arent that fond of football but do grow to like the players as people
to be fair there is an artistry to hus music	no one can dispute this
what did you think of it	i thought it was really good
i just loved viola davis role in the movie she is such a strong actress	that was a perfect role for her
so have you seen the movie the boondock saints	omg i love that movie

i guess they think people want more lightning mcqueen	maybe so have you seen any of them
i just go and look at dsw  how about you	i just bought some audrina pappil shoes from macys theyre gorg
but if thats the case then they shouldnt be owning a team in the first place	i dont disagree with you there but like i said it does benefit the city one way or another

your really think so	no but i hope we do
what do you think of nwa	i think they were pioneers in rap music
what does he sing	treat you better
i know about industrial electronic music but i dont know any industrial rock songs	you probably do have you heard du hast by rammstein or closer by nine inch nails
yeah i refuse to watch that	well the first one is great i still think the 2nd is ok
didnt it seem like a copy of a new hope	yeah i guess it was kind of a reboot
what happened to him again	he was the chosen one but chose the dark side
ash got turned to stone	and then strangely tears brought him back to life
yes but is he really dead or will there be a scifi resurrection	i dont know but i wouldnt mind seeing harrison ford in the film
it really is	i love her
well nice talking to you	you too
didnt you see alien covenant	i thought it was okay
so what are you trying to say	that zeke got game and the coach knows real talent
but so simple  its a very simplistic piece of music	and ubereffective  its too bad the sequels were so poor
do you like female rappers	there arent any
i do like the emancipation of mimi album though	yes that is some of her new material and it is still good
oh yeah i bet the kids would love that	the cars are really amazing and i love vin deisel
there were definitely some odd characters in that one too	david bowie was in that movie wasnt he
yes there are so many famous actors and oh yeah that guy moments madeline kahn just blows me away with her characters	oh her song im so tired and how she sings it is priceless she hits a home run every time
benicio del torro	that guy is always good
the thing	oh that had too much screaming for me
yeah i like bach sometimes	how about mozart
i think i know where this is going so to make more money	yes so to make more revenues the theaters started charging more for their concessions which the studios couldnt not touch at all

i guess if i decided to go id just get tickets when i get there	i wouldnt suggest that getting a ticket is very hard
what will you miss the most about your hometown	i will miss going to baltimore ravens games the most
thanks appreciate it	now what
i heard there  will be another frozen movie	yes i am anxious to take the family

sort of they have 3 albums and alot of eps	what should i check out first
ratatouille is not a good film	wow you are so wrong
yes for most of the movie	oh wow that sounds excellent
hitler magically returns to germany in 2010 but everyone thinks hes a method actor doing an impersonation	that sounds like it could be really funny but maybe a little off for a cultural movie night
yeah even someone with a great career in football is done by age 40 at the latest	a kicker might stay longer but most are finished by 40
then you would really like when harry met sally it is much better in my opinion	i have thought about watching it but have never got around to it
kind of he put out a couple albums and mixtapes but i dont think his goal was mainstream	give me some of his best songs
how did you feel about leia at the end	i was crying i saw it after carrie died
oh which one	the waterboy
he says he wants to play until 45	yeah  i dont think he will be able to
yeah maybe we are too rough on him	he is no liam neeson
im not to sure but i think if anyone can pull it off and make a great david fincher can	so david fincher will be directing the world war z sequel
whats that	since it was written using a scale there must have been a system in place so theres even older songs out there somewhere
maybe that is what the people wanted to hear	maybe for some but positve rapper was still quite popular the negative rap was pushed and pushed and it eventually became popular
whats your favorite sting song	i would say russians
hey what do you think about football	as in the nfl
yes he was also in that show called fringe his name is joshua jackson	i havent seen emilio estevez in anything else since he played the coach in these movies have you
some played the role more as ab action hero while some took a less serious approach i still prefer craig	i can see why now he seems to combine all those aspects of bonds personality into one
id have to say rodgers if you look at his stats he blows brady out of the water	as a pats fan id have to disagree and say brady stats arent everything
how so	well the action was intense and the acting was terrific  the plot was the best part though

i see any other good movies	the martian was great im a big matt damon fan too and hes in that
i liked my parents music very much though	what kind of stuff did they listen to
really were they as good in concert as they are on the radio	seriously it was one of the best concerts ive ever been to
me too it makes you think about what you would do in those situations as well	i would like to star in movies like that but i am not a actor
i loved the ballsack line which do you like from west side story	i think theres a place for us
same here i miss seeing snape and dumbledore too	its hard to believe alan rickman passed away he was the perfect snape
tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time	yes i agree

well good for him he got let go back in 1993 right	yes and sobriety is always good
its hard to keep track of all these marvel movies right	yes definitely  i think the last one i watched was the last captain america movie
oh  im a knicks fan so as usual they are not in the playoffs	wow a knicks fan i give you credit for admitting you root for those guys
but they have so much chemistry	true but i would rather they focus on the heros journey in itself rather than romantic entanglements
beatles recorded for the apple record label didnt they	true i remember their 45 records had a lime green label on them
yeah i know some guys are that big naturally but you just know that of lot of them have to be on steroids	right doesnt the nfl have any rules about the use of steroids
finally we can agree on something now im going to ask you a question that will determine the fate of your relationship	what is it
her voice is so gorgeous	it is ive always loved how versatile her voice is
i think he signed a deal with disney to work on multiple soundtracks in the future	i guess kind of like phil collins did tarzan and brother bear
not really but you have to watch it yourself lots of action	well of course with hugh jackman in it
you doing any fantasy this year	im on fanduel so good to go
it shows the bootcamp before young soldiers go to war	oh that is the whole scene of the film
oh  yea ive never seen that movie	you should watch it
i could totally see that isnt your niece a bit young to watch it since lilos parents died	no i dont think thats the main point of the movie
he often made songs about his family his mom his exwife and his daughter his lyrics run deep	thats interesting what else has he done
yes with the big hair and make up	i laugh if i see it now
lol pua  was voiced by real pigs	ill have to watch moana again after all this facts

i really enjoyed it gal godot is so beautiful	ya no kidding she was a model prior
womder woman is all about how wonderful life would be without men	its just crazy and nothing is really family friendly anymore
i used to sit and try and sing along with one and then the other	me too i think i learned how to sing harmony from listening to that band
but it seemed that his attitude changed after he met luke and realized that he was his son	i dont think so he was still trying to corrupt luke and bring him into the dark side
cant complain	do you enjoy baseball
i think so like the animated one	wonder if it has the same songs
which song did they end the show with	im down which drove the crowds nuts
yeah but the games changed so much since the 70s	but those earlier super bowls still count
why do you not agree	because the movie is cool
me either its a great genre of music	i completely agree
do you like christina aguilera	she does have a beautiful voice
did you see the last star wars movie that came out	are you talking about rogue one
thankfully there are new artists taking up his mantle some people may not like lady gaga but at least she is exploring the boundaries of art	you said it i think the future of music is going to be an exciting journey
what team do you want to watch the most	i want to watch the rams
the one that was kind of a thriller but also sort of a kids show	yes i think it will be silly
a pretty big one in my opinion	thats fair it was still a good movie though
i think he just lost his weapons and coach anybody would be bad after that	who did he lose
i think i have heard a few of there songs	i also saw them live
depends on what	when i want music in the background when i focusing on something else i like to listen to classical music or piano versions of popular songs
ive been feeling a bit nostalgic lately and ive been listening to the heart of everything	oh wow that came out what around 2007
oh well never mind then i dont want to walk out of a movie half way through  that would suck	well i know and id try to make it but with my broken hip theres only so much i can take

cute names  whats travel pizza	its a three part song that is good while traveling or driving with toddlers

that’s not who i am thinking about but what was the name of the song	“please mr postman was the name of the song i’m sure they performed it together
there are two teams in la	clippers well i am not a fan at all
the current music has a feel good vibe that i feel we missed in the 90s	yes pop music really began to take off again in the 2000s
i have loved pop music since i was pretty young	i have to who was your favorite growing up
right by hosting the tournament the us automatically gets into the title game	thats pretentious but if we host the game why wont we get an automatic bid
i do too i am excited tos ee the rookies test their skills	some are really good
yes and i loved the message of dr strange tapping into your inner strength and energy	me too i practice meditation myself to cultivate mindfulness
the falcons will do well	so will the seahawks
it is sort of a fusion between classic and modern in a way	that could be good
do you consider u2 classic rock	depends on their catalogue
yeah thatd be good	whats it called
i like the pittsburgh steelers	they are one of the best
there are quite a few	how many are they up to now
just watch the movie	ok i can do that
anything else about it	ive been reading online reviews they said it was on par with the first of the series
were there any others that you found particularly impressive	i always thought bib fortuna was cool looking
i enjoy that it has so many parts to it	it almost feles like a mini movie in itself
i know that part when she had the dried up mermaids stuck in the ocean floor was sad and disturbing	ariels dad could be scary as well like when he destroyed her special place
for sure this was a big win for the brewers even though its early in the season	yeah you want to show everyone that you are going to be a contender
this is great what do you got	ok here is spooky one
yeah its weird you dont see 2 running backs drafted so high very often i think mccaffrey is maybe too slight to be an every down back but the panthers should be able to get him the ball where he needs it	hes so fast just get him the ball in the flat and let him work his magic
do i have to start at the beginning of the harry potter series	yes they could do okay stand alone but you wont get nearly as much out of it
i could see him sacrificing himself to make up for it	that would leave the solo family with no surviving members though
in that case you will probably love this record	im going to go to the store to buy a copy today
they are not but the way they run their offense he has to be involved in each play	that is true his usage rate is off the charts
i like reggae rap rb	okay cool  who is your favorite reggae group or artist
yeah burt and sally broke up in real life so they couldnt be close in the second movie	i think this was unfair to the fans of smokey and the bandit
the worst pies in london is the title it is so good	angela lansbury played that role on stage
shut up you know those black dudes with hair extensions caught not singing their own songs or something	milli vanilli
what is the film about	they visit different parts in latin america
batman	of course i watch all of nolans movies
awesome	yeah
i love that song empty hands in a way it could be heard as a christmas song  but its really so much more	agreed its excellent and it shows something about him which i love his concern and support for the common people
some movies from oru childhood loose their touch as we get old this was still really good	did you like anything more then when you were a kid
it was one of my favorite films of the star wars world	i think it was executed so well and the script was written so well too everything in the movie felt truly captivating
do you think the panthers might pull through again like they did in 2015	i hope so but they remind me of when i lived in michigan the u of m made it to the rose bowl numerous times but lost
yeah i dont think they should have sent ellsbury home	i think you have to send him there i think he has a better chance of scoring than holliday getting another hit
not to mention that his athleticism seems to still be all there	yeah he still can move like he used to
did you know that he wrote china girl with iggy pop	yes and iggy pop actually recorded it first
yeah it will be well you let me know if you watch any of those movies	ok i will and you should really watch logan
do you like the nfl	sure i do
being in fashion shows you know whats what	yep how else could i demonstrate that to a total stranger
their contracts do vary a great deal though	that is true who is your favorite team

eminem just didnt care during those days	he said whatever he wanted whenever he wanted
yep how many are you in	im in 4 and sometimes 5

i like down by the river and cinammon girl too	yes they are good but you know which one i like
what is your favorite kind of music	i mostly like pop but lately i have been enjoying techno
how much do you like basketball	it is my favorite sport
have you seen the last harry potter movie  deathly hallows part 1 and 2	yes ive seen those
yes the fight between him and obi wan was epic as well	not as epic as that fight between yoda and the emperor
yes but not cheap	how much
what did you think of them	the third one really bothered me
end of watch is a action movie and even some funny parts	do you have it
yes dontari poe will do wonders as tackle and not to mention jack crawford to fill the end position dont forget their draft pick ups	can not forget about the pair of linbackers takk mckinley and duck riley
hon solo is like lord vader	what are you talking about
a little young for my liking lol but they are definitely some very talented individuals	do you know when the show will be on again or remember what channel the show was on

apparently the movie was becoming too comedic and screwball	what did they expect by hiring comedy directors
i didnt know that	i know you didnt when they rereleased the song in 2010 the song soared on the charts and a lot of critics believe it was because of the artistic vision of the new video she created
yeah and trubinsky as a quarterback	trubinsky was actually the top prospect for quarterbacks
helter skelter	thats a good one  you know its about a slide at a playground right

i like talking about music	okay it is easiest to talk about anyway
you even like classical	sometimes if im in the right mood for it ill listen to it

true if youre trying to expand your musical taste into progressive rock though king crimson is a must they are considered one of the most important bands of that era	im definitely interested in that kind of music and i probably have heard them but just cant recall any of their songs at the moment

do you have a favorite	not really i just saw boss baby
in the air tonight is one of my favorite songs ever	have you seen the hangover
did john carpenter do it	yes it might be his best movie
what sort of artists do you consider classic	i really like willie nelson johnny cash and waylon jennings to name a few
anyways it was great talking to you	i agree lets do it again sometime
fresh off the runway diamonds and numb are my favorites on that album	mine are stay and what now those are incredible songs
yeah it is what do you think we need more	not really i think 5s a good number
i dont remember many of their songs but i remember one called blowing free	i remember that one too
his music bridged the two styles even though it is considered classical by most	so beethoven used complex chords
did you watch the force awakens	not yet
i noticed her newest album had more vocals	yes and now i can enjoy listening to her
so of course they love the music of their teens and early 20s so they rate it the highest	and kind of mythologize the whole era into something greater than it actually was
i agree	yea
what was it like	it was almost metallic im not sure how to describe it other than gritty and dynamic but in control
they need to change the three point line	why
i know they are making a lot of live action remakes but i just really enjoy their animated movies	i doubt disney will ever stop making animated movies dont worry
i seethat was an exciting time i remember waiting in line for tickets so much buzz	there really was a ton of hype what was your most memorable

whos your favorite folkpop rock artist	i think mine would have to be colbie caillat
when i was in college my roommate and i would always listen to that one and bed of roses	i forgot about a bed of roses that is also a classic
i agree they added d jackson his deep threat is going to open the field up for mike evans	yes mike evans is another big bodied receiver he will be great this year
you heard about the oscars fiasco i assume	i did i feel sorry for the filmmakers but i think moonlight deserved it
i mean you could be right but both teams have had their screw up moments	i cant disagree but the angels have trout and the rangers do not
but the soundtrack was so prominent in those films in the force awakens it kind of disappeared	i guess so i cant really remember any tracks as memorable as the imperial march or the star wars theme
but is that all you listen to	no i like other stuff mozart and indie rock
i heard that rise against is playing in the area soon theyre another one of my favorites	seems like youve got some eclectic tastes when it comes to music who else are you into
i think eric clapton is up there too	definitely
gaston was great though expertly cast	well if they did gaston right i guess i will have to go check it out
but thats essential to the entire series  why do you think that	in the first movie luke and han were everyman heroes  making luke vaders son turns him into a chosenone superhero who comes by his by by his genetics
with marlon brando right	thats right that was before he did the godfather

i think the kentucky wildcats are going make it all the way	well i feel the cincinnati bearcats haveva chance as well
have you ever seen her in concert	no but id like to
they kissed at the end but its like does sarah know who chuck is yet	it was a really strange and unnecessary cliffhanger
ya its sad that carrie fisher died	ya i wonder if they will address that in the next movie i forget what it is called
he was pretty awsome durning his time	he was playing durning the time of the steel curtain
have you ever heard of blink 182	yes wow its been years since ive heard their songs
which game was crazier the cowboys and packers or patriots and falcons	tough call but i have to go with the super bowl comeback by the patriots
i think  interscope records	do you know some of the producers
couldnt agree more thrash metal punk hardcore just needs that edge	absolutely it needs to get near want to be moving i guess punk would be my absolute favorite though
he has to be fuming	i cant wait for the repeat
there was a lot of deep stuff i missed the first time	like what
yeah i love the way he uses off beat and tones in his music	is it supposed to be just like the other stuff he did
i figured it a more diverse topic	of course
and who else	nigel williams plays defensive end
the penny dreadful version	tim curry couldve played the clown in the remake
have you ever watched rocky horror picture show	of course its a classic

you should lets get a copy soon	ok

i was thinking of comedy i really want to have a good laugh	oh i definitely know which one you have too see the one called don´t blame the kid
they recently lost a band member too	thats sad
whats your favorite star wars character	i dont have one
i love that movie theres some intense parts in it	yeah like how they chop the guys up in the basement
well they fire coach julien so whoever they get to replace him has got to be better	no doubt hell bring in some real talent that isnt afraid to get rough
goofy sort of comes of as an outcast in my opinion which makes him worse than donald	how does that make sense
yeah this is an organization that needs to start over from scratch	yeah this team wont be good for a long long time
which nfl team do you think has the best uniforms	i might be biased because blue is my favorite color but the broncos blue jerseys look pretty great
that was the ghost they caught at a rock concert  now that was a funny scene	all their gadgets were updated
i hope that in upcoming movies if they have a battle its longer than 30 seconds they definitely did really well with that in rogue one	oh rogue one was freaking amazing disney hasnt let me down yet with any of their productions
and tom hanks hes in everything	yeah i dont think theres a single film genre he hasnt been in at some point or other
le fe verte  its about absinth	what was the movie

he did terribly	i think he needs to become more mature
where do you listen to your music most of the time	mostly i listen on my phone but i still have a record player that i use for old albums
i heard that movie was scary	it is scary because it could happen you should face your fears though
i think he had a miniseries based on the character as well	yes i think so too
you seem to only like scary movies do you have a favorite comedy	thats a hard one does it have to be strictly a comedy or can it be a funny horror movie
what instruments does lady gaga play	she plays piano most of the time but can play guitar drums and keytar
what about you	i like 70s era music

ill definitely go with you i hope he plays nature feels	oh me too i love dancing to that one
whats your favorite baseball team	the boston red sox
what kind of issues	well one example is that while japan was trying to fight off godzilla themselves other countries around the world are itching to intervene because theyre worried about getting attacked themselves there was a lot that dealt with how events would realistically take place if a country was under attack by something that they couldnt stop
question for you	sure
pretty much any of the older albums are good	great

33	its sort of unusual that someone of your age is a fan of them
you dont watch march madness	nope

i tried watching them and well	well
hes come such a long way from nostalgic 64	did you know began rapping in the sixth grade
well all those bad years helped you get peyton in the draft	thank god because if it wasnt for peyton the colts may have left indiana

the generation that knows nothing about music	clearly  now im going to have to hear her songs on the radio all the time

her dad wasnt involved and her mom committed suicide	oh thats so sad  but i like movies that are both happy and sad
yeah thats a great example they trashed that one but i absolutely love it	i love scfi movies in general the fourth kind is one of my favorites
what did you wish for	i wished for a lot of things
they are very devoted to soccer in europe its like the main sport whereas here you have competition between football basketball and baseball as to which is the favorite	with the way they are spread out over the seasons it makes it easy to be a fan of all three
yes especially considering that its based off of a ride at disney	i know its unbelievable
whats a favorite lyric of yours	all we are is an isle of flightless birds we find our worth in giving birth and stuff were lining our homes against winding roads and we think the going is tough
definitely	i would love to get it
how so	well they didnt have a whole lot of time in the indie scene
yes its very complex and they get it right it could have been confusing but they managed to nail it	totally and i really liked anne hathaway as well i dont get why people dont like her

i just saw the new alien movie	alien covenant how was it
only one other in 2014 im sure theyll release another sooner or later	if they keep that schedule youll probably get a new album next year in 2018
he has won bet award for video director of the year as one of them	i think he also won teen choice award for single male artist too
yes  and it did humanize things a bit	i did like a female protagonist
well drake ruined a beautiful track by black coffee he not only sampled it but put another womans vocals on it that sounds awful	haha that sounds about accurate when mainstream gets its hands on underground art they ruin it
its just such a good character	have you ever read the book
just i need to get better	you will
i think so that kind of music doesnt ever go out of style	not with everyone at least
aw man	why
has lady gaga had any new music out lately	not that i know of earlier this year she had a few new songs
i liked anakin and dooku showed his progress and was shortandsweet	obiwan surviving a platform falling on him was a bit ridiculous
i did not know that	they changed it in the lat 90s i think
some of the new ones are really good as well	i like jason aldean lady antebellum luke bryan and others as well
i saw that last week as well it really was fantastic	i need to start going with you
exactly i have high hopes for them	better than the dolphins haha

like the simpsons	yes and the sponge bob movie
right youre locked in  even with supplies what are you going to do	yeah its not like a fallout shelter
seriously	yep
i know some country artists are pulling the same crap too	the best autotune shall always be tpain
oh ive heard of them before	yes they are very popular in my hometown
do you think country music has gotten better or worse over the years	honestly i dont think it has changed all that much
have you see land of the dead	yeah i liked it but it was a clear step back from the first 3 movies in the dead series
mine as well	who do you like
yes that is it precisely	that means people who like different things managed to find things to really like about it
ok then how was frank gore such a great rusher	for crying outloud maybe he blew off the test too besides rbs score about 16 were not talking about a 4 here
king louie was pretty entertaining	i liked him a lot but i wasnt expecting him to be so huge
raunchy  what do you mean by that	i mean comedies that are explicit in some way or crossing the lines of what is considered politically correct
i think its just called dna	oh yeah i heard some of that one on the radio the other day
for sure the senators did you see the predators play again tomorrow	yeah i have  a game night planned for that we are going to play cards and watch the game

i have always loved music  what does that song say weve been together for such a long time my music and me	the jacksons song
i agree	yeah that is what makes them also good
oh is that it because ive been waiting  and im gonna move soon so im not sure what to do about that	that must be annoying yeah im sure you could write to them
the cartoon such as classic the music is just so wonderful	i agree the new one was good but never as good as the original
korean pop	wownever heard of that
it appears to be the answer	geez that doesnt bode well for the up and coming acts
one of the singers is also singing for blink 182 right now	ok i know who you are talking about
i heard that it got good reviews and it wasn’t just for one gender but that everybody liked it	it did get good reviews  i liked it and so did my date
i love any movie hugh jackman is in but wolverine is by far my favorite character	the only thing that confuses me is i thought professor x died in the last stand
i mean we turn down professional musicians too if you think about it	we do
what is so challenging about that piece	it involves a lot of quick fingering and involves a wide range of notes
i bought this album because i heard some great reviews from some of my closest friends	oh great i hope they turn out to be correct
are we debating	no im just telling you about lady gaga
i love michael jackson	yes i wish he could still make music
awesome  go out and buy heaven and hell and mob rules	i will do that  is that the only two albums i should buy
hey how do you feel about the upcoming season	kind of depressed actually
i was going to go with another friend of mine on sunday too	do you want to sit together
yes and its ok i just preferred the animated version im old school i guess	yeah we grew up in the era of disney movies like aladdin
the ending was really good	yeah it had a great ending
i like that too it has such a classic sound but for its time it really bucked the country trend	i know and unfortunately we now have artists that think country and rap go together
i am really starting to like the children animation movies that i watch with my daughter	yes those movies are great
they are but did you see the comment lorde just made about their relationship a lot of people are quite angry	no i didnt what did lorde say
do you know much about the movie	no ive heard some things though
honestly now that elliot and prescott are showing signs of being something special im feeling it again still nowhere near the seahawks rivalry but it could get there	49ers and cowboys is another one
he played the character just right to me	he did have the understated and mysterious quality down
yeah that is one of the things i liked about this one that it shows how maybe if aliens come to earth it would be to help us	absolutely i also liked that approach
yeah the cardinals were able to bring back a lot of their veterans	do you think they can get out of their division though
i like country mainly	oh good i do too
i think the 49s could bounce back a little though they have some some talent	how about good old jacksonville
oh yea and each clone had a different part of his personality	right that was pretty good too
i still cry when snape says always	yeah that was heartbreaking
very noticeable yes i suppose most fans will be forgiving of that though	i know i am
my favorite beatles song has to be i wanna hold your hand	that is one of my favorites too
i dont think many people have heard of soen another group that tool fans like is porcupine tree	ive heard of them i would say theyre similar to radio head

yeah rob ryan really screwed us over	yeah theyre defense has been terrible
i think i disagree the pitcher the braves got is going to be a legend one of these days	who is the pitcher you are talking about

tim conway is in do you remember that actor	no cant say that i do
yeah i also like the vocals and the mix of voices the song has	have your heard the new mix with justin bieber
how do you think they hold up to the prequels	i would put the force awakens on par with episode two
what is your all time favorite comedy like the one you want to watch over and over	easy the princess bride
yeah yeah no this next ones going to be about rey and luke didnt you see the trailer	i guess i just wasnt paying that much attention since i disliked rogue one so much
like what theyll tell us the movies that are coming out this specific year	more than that you can actually see online that a bunch of disneypixar movies are coming out in 2019 and 2020
i really get into those	do you have a favorite player
oh that was a cute one too	yeah kind of
it could cost them but if hes hurt then they are geniuses	i think they made good moves this offseason to improve the team
thats a good point  but they should at least give him a comic	the comics have even fewer readers than rebels has viewers
i know right mark wahlber who knew he could be so funny	and the bear cracks me up also
yeah the alien one	is it good
have your kids watched all of the disney classics like snow white fantasia or bambi	theyve watched a few but not all the kids dont care for the graphics because theyre not like todays movies
are you much of a country music fan	no i cant say i am

friggin chocolate cake shake sounds amazing	we should make one
yo you ready for the next nfl season	heck yeah i am
it was a bit long though	see i dont think so

i like all the special effects in all the star wars movies	yeah  me toohave you played any star wars video games
no problem i had somebody do that to me with the movie logan	yeah i heard that people were going around spoiling that movie for everyone
yeah somewhat	somewhat
a long was from the cheeky pop she used to sing	yes i loved her song teenage dream
it was so sad when fred weasley died and dobbys death was super sad too	and hedwig for some reason that one hit me the hardest
well i can understand that the second one is very bad	its just so slow and the twists come out of nowhere
yeah thats right	his nickname was jaws
have you seen the conjuring 2	yes i saw it in the theater when it was first released
i love her song in this momet	thats a good one
talladega nights is really funny you ever see it	yes will ferrell is hilarious
yeah and escaped the hospital for the criminally insane	yeah she was a very detailed character
yes it was awesome	i guess ill go see it whats it about again
yeah i mean tobymac had his whole solo thing michael tait has newsboys now but kevin just sort of fell off the radar	i hear hes singing lead for audio adrenaline now
hey do you know when baseball season starts	yeah its already started
if you are  in need of a homicidal clown extravaganza this spooky season then check out clown town	it sounds generic and boring
dingdingding we have a winner	that was a truly great year for movies

well i dont know i dont follow them that closely  my kid wants a fidget spinner too	yeah i need to get a browns colts patriots and a shudder jets fidget spinner when i place my order

i did i hated the zohan  movie did you like it	no it was garbage did you see the spanglish more serious movie
yes it is	no but i saw it didnt get great reviews
remember the song the wind cries mary	yea that was a good one and so was purple haze
very good what was walter paytons nickname	sweetness
yes the alien is answering  a call from nasa and when he gets here of course they shoot down his craft	let me guess then they start trying to catch him
oh yeah thats what the preseason games are for	i never watch those
that album was so dark	everything about it was moody and dark
if you could see a side movie about any harry potter character who would it be	mad eye no doubt
i grant you there is no larry bird but the rest of the core are much younger and more athletic	but they dont have larry  bird or anything close
someone very concerned with fashion	heh and the dalmatians were just collateral damage
that sounds crazy	it was one player would hike the ball and then try to pus their way down the hallway toward the doorway on the other end which was the goal line
have you heard about the movie gigantic	no what is it
yes that too	i used to love the backstreet boys
who do you like	i like the chainsmokers and taylor swift

like wonderwoman and ghostbusters	exactly
he has some great music  i love to turn the volume up when i hear his songs	what is your favorite fm radio station
gotcha  weird how he could shoot himself in the head and not die	guess he had the right angle on the bullet path
which one should i listen to do you think	i like here that was her breakout song
i love when he mentions the toilet store	ha that scene is such a classic
who does patrick steward do the voice of	hes the poop character if you can believe it
alright i might consider it	actually the first one is really good you should just watch it just because its a good movie
yeah maybe watch aladdin too	good choice man disney had a lot of good movies in the 90s
name another then	soccer
on the topic of villains what about cruella deville	best evil name ever
what about the second and third	i didnt bother watching the third
yeah thast when someone mixes two songs together from different artist	yes well i heard a mash up of all three of them and the sound was amazing
why is that the last one that came out was a disappointment for me	i think that mark wahlberg will do another good job of acting in this movie michael bay does make good movies at times
did you like fast  furious 6	yeah i did mostly because the rock was in it
no kidding i love barry manilow hes my man	my first concert was actually him my mom took me even tho i did not want to go
okay but betty buckley is performing minor roles in horror movies now i dont think her vocal chords are all that active anymore	theres still barbara streisand
you caught me no im on harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban	thats my least favoritthey changed so much from the book the firebolt was given to harry at the beginning not the end
not the same	how so
me too not only the movie but the music too	that has to be one of the best disney movies
are you going to any concerts coming up	no plans you
you like them	love them
yeah valerian and the city of a thousand planets its a sci fi adventure flick	this is the first i have heard of it does it look good
no not really anything more than the usual i bet theyll have some good parties though maybe some better stories about going out to the club	ha agreed i think itll be alright too
you know what bugs me	whats that
he goes on a revenge kick hunting down the people who changed him so he get his face disfigured by his powers fixed and get his girl back	okay sound different ill try to make time to watch it
they were which made it enjoyable to me	how so
well for all of her music that we didnt get to see we can always find it on goggle or you tube	after her death so many people especially those who knew her personally are left sad but her memories of her music and just being whitney will go on and on
yea its so suspensful	i agree its really good though
for sure	how
hey did you go to dc101s kerfuffle	no i liked some of the bands playing but not others
hes not american is he	nope welsh i believe
not that you would hear on the regular radio	do they sing the warriors code it was in a movie
and screamed while doing it	no kidding  total hero at that time
they should be able to compete but that division belongs to oakland	never count out denver though
wonder what would happen if they won the super bowl this year and then moved out	difficult to tell wonder if the fans would be more behaved and send them off on a good farewell or even be more infuriated
hard to describe he was a voice for lonely misfits i think	that sounds depressing
awesome this will be a lot of fun	when is the concert
have you seen the second zoolander movie	i did not know their was a second
so i think that will almost ensure he wins and his team wins	will be interesting to see a third straight finals
thats odd to see a tv commercial by a band	yeah it was in cooperation with spotify i guess to drum up more sales
yes it was  mark wahlberg is such a good actor  i cant believe how closely the movie followed the actual events	it was pretty good  i couldnt take my eyes off of it  another good one is hacksaw ridge  thats a true story too
hey i just heard a great song yesterday	oh yeah what is it
did the redskins ever win a super bowl	yeah they won super bowl xvii back in the early 80s
great i am planning to watch it this saturday do i need to watch the first one	you should otherwise you may not know the characters in the movie
i love his movies they are so fun	yes that one is a bit of a thriller
what the major league composed of	i think national and american
she was almost unrecognizable in that role	i was so pleasantly surprised how she held her own with monique in the scene near the end of the movie
they were a rock group back in the 60s	what does ccr stand for
not particularly by osmosis i like the giants and dislike the patriots	thats funny any other team preferences
and when did you start	in 1999 where the denver beat the falcons for the title
okay so snow white and the seven dwarfs was the first disney movie to come out but what was the first disney pixar movie	i believe it was toy story
i always loved ringo how about you	i was always a big fan of paul mccartney
our recievers are pretty good	well we dont have calvin anymore

did you just say et cetera out loud thats weird	sorry
i have not seen anyone perform it as good	i know right

me too	dude im going to see him next month
princess leia is one of my favorites because she is such a strong woman	what about luke
oh yeah i remember back in the old day when she became famous from what album are they	these songs you can find them in the album let go

unfortunately they were all sold out very quickly so i didnt get the chance to buy one	thats a shame hopefully youll get another chance in the future
that i do other than him who or what gives you the creeps	i think it would have to be ursula from the little mermaid

well it is based on a video game	what video game
have you been watching the nba playoffs	yeah i havent missed a game yet  who are you pulling for
so the original had the webcam against her knowledge including some nude scenes	true thats a crime these days and should have been then too anything wrong with pie 2

i have never heard of it	it is usually the gate way film for many getting into film
you didnt think it was funny	even as a kid i thought it sounded stupid
you got it	he is still rockin
so is u2 going to have a new album soon or what	not sure  i keep hearing they will be but nothing ever happens
my sister said cinderella was the best disney movie ever she said every little girl saw that movie and cheered for cinderella and dreamed of meeting a primce charming like her	thats a tough one i think cinderella might be a little more better known than bambi just because the name is still mentioned when talking about evil stepmothers
but why do you not know the other teams	because i like philly cheese steaks
with zac efron and the rock	yeah
do you think it is his best	i think its his second best but its more accessible than to pimp a butterfly which is my favorite
maybe but its more of an affectionate parody in that case theyre a fun group	whats your favorite song by them
chasing pavements she released it as adele adkins	i remember that i dont think i know anything else off of that first album
i dont see how i think he was crucial but not important	that seems like an oxymoron
you need to listen to their other albums	i have though
have you been listening to selena gomez	not really
what other guitar players do you like	slash dave gilmour stevie ray vaughn
i read he has freakish athletic ability is that true	i havent seen him play before but i heard his arms are crazy long
thats such a good album every song on it is amazing i likes the song jane says and ted just admit it	dont forget had a dad and summertime rolls like you said though i could call every song on that album my favorite
oh yes lots there are pendant ocarinas which are the smallest and highest pitched and also some of the prettiest there are ocarinas made from vegetables and even an ocarina and teacup in one	pendant ocarinas as in you can wear them as a necklace
yea beavis and butthead office space and idiocracy	no extract in there
i bet the kids loved it	oh yeah they couldnt stop laughing which i guess is the point
oh wow i didnt realize there had been that many	yep there has been one every two or three years since 2007
well i really was engrossed by gypsy caravan i think that is the title  follows a bunch of different clans of musician gypsys	i think i have seen it it was really good
brad pitt	i think i seen a trailer for that one was it good

i know what you mean	thriller is one of the best albums of all time
what country was he from	germany
they are funny especially thanks to chris pratt	yeah hes great one of my favorite actors

have you heard of the new song by julia michaels	which one is that and i dont think i know who she is
why is that	the falcons performed the greatest choke of all time
at the expense of the viewer	hardcore fans go to any action movie regardless of a thinning plot line
oh did you see where wonder woman came out at the movies	really no i hadnt heard
i think dak will be a good quarterback	i think he will be good but i need to see another year to really say
he acted pretty well and was also pretty funny	i liked it when he took captain americas shield
yes it is seriously underrated	oh why is that so

like true ian fleming ones	yes set closer to the time he was actually like a secret agent
i was thinking beauty and the beast	nice do you know who the actors are in this one

im glad they didnt put all 23 personalities in the movie though it would have been too complicated	i agree sometimes it was hard to remember between the names and personalites
have you ever heard of pete wentz	he plays bass right
yeah but what type of pop	so youre pressing me to define her specific contribution to the music scene
would you still buy his albums	as long as he makes one i will
wow i had no clue on that leon on was crazy popular	my favorite of 2015
not necessarily you can go online and get a lot of ideas for a wardrobe	what sites do you use for that
but john was this assassin how does this man get the best of him	john was still mourning the lost of his wife and he was caught off guard
honestly id like them to bring the idea back	same maybe they were struggling with how to make the setting work with the characters but i know disney can do it
yes his videos online received many views	what makes him great
acdc i’m constantly listening to them lately	what’s your favorite track
well you definitely have to listen to his other music because i would agree the songs on the radio are more overrated than they need to be	well what songs should i listen to then

of course i was just reading an article about him the other day	what did it say
am i the only one that didnt like monsters inc	im sure there are others
apparently the character maui is a big huge guy and it upset people because they felt it was sterotyping polynesians as fat	well some of them are really big
you assume i am also a child of the 80s  adam west was my first idea of batman so no	interesting i sometimes forget about adam west maybe it is generation thing which batman you think is best and not actually based on acting chops
youre such a snob lets do specifically the classical era	my favorite is beethoven
did you like the first one	yeah it was pretty good
i always loved that song ironic i used to listen to it all the time	yea that is a great song actually it never gets old when you listen to it
but there are so many great rock bands	name a few of them
do you like the dark side or the light	im a fan of the dark side
i love the final battle scene outside of endor and i think that the final confrontation between luke and vader is really dramatic and meaningful	i see youre point im an empire guy myself but rotj did have some great moments
yeah except with singing and dancing	nice
i wish the beatles had been in a disney song	right they were supposed to voice the vultures in the jungle book
first game of the nfl season no way	yeah its gonna be interesting two super bowl champs playing each other
it was an amazing film i liked the score	the music is really perfect in that movie
yeah they did  then they just sorta disappeared	yeah but rucker definitely reappeared on the scene
teasers have become the way to go	i do have an appreciation for teasers that leave you thinking im not sure what this is but i want to see it
yes we are overdue for a world series win	those guys in the 90s were fantastic players
you went to the killswitch engage and anthrax concert i was there too which band was your favorite	i went to see anthrax it was cool to hear the old stuff i love caught in the mosh i did stay for killswitch engage and those guys were really good too
is eminem from detroit	yes he grew up there
is it tired	yes it tells the same old story again and again and not really well
they also have a couple of albums	which one is a good one
he acted pretty well in that movie	and the script worked perfect for him
you think its more important than the beat	maybe you can have a good flow without a beat
yes those are love songs with soul	can you name a few good ones
well lakers need some hope what a mess	yeah theyre my favorite team and its sad to see how bad they are
do you have a favorite michael jackson song	oh i have a bunch it would take a while to list them all
its the most pretentious thing in the world its not a series in any form whatsoever	how so
i get that when i am in the car i like to listen to slower songs and relaxing songs	i am the same way
who is that	he was another musician who never was as popular
yea then they show just how psycho the wife was and how she set the whole thing up	such a good twist
hi	hey
i guess that is individual preference	yes that is just what i feel
who got the most points in yesterdays game	russels got the most points yesterday
i love the brand of rock that sideonedummy continues to sign onto their label	truly one of the most consistent labels around
its rap but he has some producers that have a more jazzy style	i cant imagine its the type of jazz i like
no i think it is vibrant	you should listen to hughs latest album
youre right about that  vader would never have had a tantrum	exactly he may be powerful but needs to grow up
if i had to rank them my order would be the dark knight interstellar inception the prestige memento batman begins the dark knight rises	now that ive had a little time to think about it i think my all time favorite nolan movie would have to be the dark knight and inception i like interstellar next and everything else is sort of in the same category for me
yes there are some morally gray rebels but its not like rooting for the separatists over the republic the empire is just evil through and through	but the separatists arent evil
what sort of movie did you see tonight	i saw some spiderman movie it was pretty interesting
old	led zeppelin is great
no as in the movie	i dont think i saw that one
yep not even once	so you dont understand any of the references ive ever made
i do too	its great
the home team was booed by the crowd as they were in the process of getting destroyed it was pretty classic boston sports fans behavior	red sox fans in specific and boston sports fans in general a tough to please you need to produce or they turn on you
we have a good line up this years and i think we will surprise you	ha not a chance we win against the lions constantly
hes got a pretty decent acting career going on so he might just go back to that	i wonder if thats because hes a connection to hollywood
i agree hes so underrated	brilliant guitarist  he was just a laid back guy and personality compared to the rest
didnt he do a movie with jennifer lopez	yes it was jersey girl its not funny at all so dont bother
i like animations obviously you know looking at this list does remind me that some dreamworks movies were flops	not all studios can produce hits all of the time every time
do you listen to joy division	no tell me about them
i think music is an important element in a movie	really depends on how the story goes
i think just a statement that shes different from other pop stars and not afraid to do something outside of the box you know	i suppose either way i like her music
i thought it was great	doesnt it have that actor in it
i dont remember seeing a saxophone but they did have a trumpet	did you know that i can play the trumpet
finefrom our lifetime	well that doesnt narrow it down as much as i would like but i would have to choose the harry potter series
you remember paul mccarthys band on the run	yeah and i think i still have the album in storage thats eighties music you know
date night usually is dinner and we be ready to go home after	what tye of movies do you like
hey what do you think about football	american or european
i think so ive never drawn out a map or anything	so what teams do you like then
must have been hard last season when you barely one 1 game	a win is a win and you get them where you can
they are like the perfect band from los angeles they also just have such a grunge like style	yeah totally but also its got that metal element that i so enjoy
was cinderella any good	it was ok im kinda tired of every princesses always needing a prince to save them
any other ones you know of	moonlit crib is a good group for baby songs
well after so many years whats the point	exactly why ruin it if it works
ugh this thing never ends	you want music this is it
kane was a fool for letting his homie make copies	thats how fools get jammed up doing something dumb
yes that dun da da thing keeps happening over and over	but if you listen underneath it keeps changing that little bit of melody is floating on top of something thats always moving and shifting around
me too	im so googling her right now
i like cabin in the woods and that is a really funny horror movie	agreed very original i think that was a great movie
thats a classic i love that one	yeah me too  hes such a funny guy
the next game is tomorrow i got ticketsdo you want to go	yea sure
not this one two women get stuck out in the middle of a swamp and their boat is just a few feet away from them but they cant get to it	so what do they do
i really liked them in the 90s	what is your favorite song from that group
cause they keep failing expectations	i mean their window is closing as hank gets older
have you ever seen them live	yes i have seen them twice
who do you think is better kendrick lamar or j cole	thats a hard one but ill have to go with jcole
bang bang	oh i think i heard that on the radio
elvis huh what song was it	it was called his latest flame i used to get it stuck in my head all the time when i was little
yes thats ridiculous and not necessary for the story	this is supposed to be fantasy no need to make things more realistic to modern life
i believe they will be all the more better	we shall see  how bout lynch this year
why is that	the situation and plot is a lot more scarier than the others
i would say techno music is my favorite when i want to go running or do exercise	do you think music is getting better or worse
hey you have to take adviceare you going to go to every movie out there	well you have a point  but tom hanks emma watsonhow can you go wrong
even though i did not play much and was not that successful i still had alot of fun	i wish i had staye din better shape as i look back at my life but i have always had my weight issues
they could still call the game though	it makes me wonder why they play in stadiums without roofs
do you remember which one it was	yes it was nick lachey
i think it was stay by zedd and alessia cara	i havent heard that song unless something new has come out it will probably stay on top
you do what artists do you like	i like luke bryan faith hill and tim mcgraw
last year was definitely not their year	i know were a long way from their 1985 championship
i dont want to hurt brady but i want that win bad	well if lose maybe we can beat them in january
however if they keep playing this well on the road and begin to hit at home anything is possible	yeah but that is a lot of ifs i just dont see it happening
who do you prefer katy perry or taylor swift	taylor swift definitely i found 1989 to be the best pop album of the past five years
who is your favorite actor	i really like tom hanks
i think its led zeppelin	thats now a bad choice what about metallica
that reminds me of a knights tale although that wasnt really a comedy but it had some funny stuff in it	the one with heath ledger
maybe a mini album from her superbowl appearance	now that would rock
oh did she how well does she sing	she has an amazing voice she sang a rendition of hello by lionel richie
did you like it	yeah it was a pretty good movie
aladdin	that was a good one
oh how cool  good information and knowledge	thanks i love talking about music history
still going to watch those movies	yeah but you dont have to go and spoil them for me
oh you should  its awesome	do you have it
yes he has	i enjoy watching him with the 3 pointers
sounds like it but not really	what else happens
black panther is going to be great too i hope that one does really well	i hope it does as least as great as wonderwoman you know really break some records out there
i like that pop song that was popular in the 80s	can you describe the song
aww that is really sweet i did not realize how adorable the lyrics were	they really are what a nice show of affection to have if you are his son or any son really
but he ended up being the most normal maybe	i think kokomo brought them back into peoples minds in the late 80s
maybe	yes im pretty sure it was is it about a war correspondent in afghanistan
i will for sure be pulling for the chiefs	same here
yeah i know its like impossible to be in a bad mood while you listen to it	exactly like hakuna matata really makes me forget about all of my worries
trust me its like french fries and ice cream	ill have to try that
little fang is basically the monster mash of our generation	what is that
yeah they were nominated and its far more original	but its such a short song
hopefully he will be included in the new ones  id love to see him have more of a presence	yeah i might actually make an effort to watch them then
i think that the older movies are better  have you ever seen rear window	no i dont think i have  whats it about
do you know much about jazz music	no not really its never appealed very much to me
man i am nervous	why are you nervous
i have been listening to the new song by metallica	whats it called
i like kodak black mostly but i do like old stuff from 2011 like lil wayne	i like lil wayne too and i only know kodak black by one song
hundred percent but id argue diving on a loose ball is significantly different from blocking much bigger defenders downfield when your block as the quarterback really isnt most likely gonna do much same sentiment tho so i get your point ill never understand cams reaction in the super bowl	tell that to drew brees
i know what is mulan with reflection or honor to us all	and dont forget ill make a man out of you by donny osmond
as of recent all of the new york football teams sure have been bad	i agree thats pretty clear
i just saw that show hateful eight made me want to watch some more westerns	well i happen to know of a lot of good ones
hey have you seen that movie nine lives	no but i did see the trailers  how was it
did you see the super bowl last year	most definitely
no he said the headmaster sent him and the headmistress wasnt dead why did you think that	well when she says she thinks she killed the guy and mentions the boy he says there is no boy and only 3 of them there
i agree i didnt expect it to be good from the trailer	i didnt expect it to be good either i thought it was overhyped
why them  theyre terrible	i lived in florida most of my life
what do you think of green bay	i think all they got is aaron rodgers  thats a pretty good all but he cant do it alone
yeah his mental toughness is almost nonexistant	he is such an amazing receiver all these antics need to stop
its really crazy to think about movies before the internet really took off	i cant imagine movies before imdb
yeah i will start with episode 1 and see young anakin	he is a great character who earns to fight well and he changes a lot so pay attention
for sure it gets me moving	i like to have new stuff leafed in my playlist so i am hearing favorites and new together
new england was lucky to draft such a player	theyve been a dynasty for years as a result  but he doesnt have many years left
dont let the sun go down on me	you have good taste in music
yay the rolling stone gimme shelter	have you seen it
why you say that	just chilling at home
yes he did well at the recording studio but he forgot the lyrics in puerto rico during a concert with luis fonsi	for real well it is common for latin singers to sing in english but not vice versa what i really like is electronic music you are full of options to choose from
brandon marshall is still playing and he is a wide reciever	i like him and i like seeing him on sports shows also
wow that is a gorgeous piece of jewelry	thanks
anything to stay relevant i guess	well alternative artists arent really going down that path
have you finished the harry potter series yet	i havent yet
that scene was so scary and traumatic for her i bet	i am glad she got them back though very moving story
what song	candy it is very catchy and fabulous
i love sandy	sandy and danny are great characters
i just watched superbowl iii	the first afl superbowl victory
what ever happened to dubstep	dubsteps still alive my friend
it also has jude law	thats cool
it is where she plays a hiker	oh that sounds interesting
my favorite part was the theory that baze and chirrut	whats the theory
i like that song	im listening to it right now and forgot how beautiful it is
you cant miss out	why not
he played one of jyns mentors	he is a good actor
do you like the chainsmokers	not really i do not think they are very talented
and really sweet	maybe next time
i dont know if that might have been because they coached when we were growing up though	it could be but they both did pretty decently
yep thats how it went	who were the stars of the movie
ezekiel elliot i want to see if he has another monster season	yeah he was amazing last season
demi lovatto rainn wilson kelly asbury and mandy patinkin star in this kids movie	who is the director
yeah hiphop is really great at mixing up beats	i was out running when i first heard it and i swear i got faster
i cant stand the theme music for orange is the new black i must mute it	it has the same affect on me its jarring even though it matches the feeling of being in jail
the tickets for the pats vs giants game	could be an hour maybe two
hi there	hey
when does the club meet for practice	i think they meet at lunchtime
noi wish	how did you get those tickets
my kids broke their frozen dvd today	oh no
tom brady definitely has at least another 23 playing years in him	what would say if gronk didnt come back
do you like that song called dram	it is okay i hear it on the radio all the time i do not know a lot of hip hop artist
it really is i saw it on netflix though if you want to check it out	thanks i just might
i am a big colts fan	my wife is from indianapolis so we pull for them also
i actually know the answer to that one too	no way
no kpop can be pretty heady stuff sometimes thats what i mean when i say im going crazy	well dont go too crazy you need to be sane for when i show you my favorite music
yes love that one	i literally watched that movie on repeat as a kid
yea the nfl	its fun to watch
i will man	good plan
the seahawks confuse me in general last year you guys beat the patriots in an amazing game but then you also had that 66 game against the cardinals and then a 93 game against the rams	any team with a good dline or some sort of elite pass rusher can give seattle a ton of difficulties
do you know about the grateful dead	i have about them but i never listened to their music
the cowboys rivalry with the redskins is cool to watch	it is called one of the greatest in sports
give the man a chance he hasnt even started yet and youre skeptical	im not skeptical i just dont like wasting my money ill probably see it
did you know that he also has written songs for other artists	yeah i know hes written for justin bieber one direction and quite a few other artists
that would have been a good compromise	what they really should have done is asked her what color she wanted her dress to be and gone with that
that they have but do you think their new coach is going to do better or worse than the last one	i dont think you can do much worse than chip kelly did last season
im not bitter i have taste	if you dont like star wars what do you like
really i did not know that	do you know who the was the only coach in nfl history to average more than one playoff win in 10 seasons of coaching
i think so they had such a row that lucas resigned from the academy	not a good look for the academy chasing away a premier filmmaker of the day
did you know that her parents stilll have the same home and phone number as when she grew up	no bet that phone rings off the hook i heard she was bullied so much when she was in high school
yes they didnt need to cut out too many parts	that was one thing that bugged me about some of the other films especially deathly hollows
and acdc gave it the edge that spawned hard rock	see thats why it couldnt go any further
remember sex and candy and better than ezra	oh man better than ezra good i used to blast that song so dumb
i agree with that pick that song definitely brings back some fun memories	i do think she is very talented and has a unique personality
when ron tried to cast that spell on malfoy	oh yeah eat slugs
lucy liu was great	uma thurman looked fabulous
well humble is not always good	neither is flashy
why adele has so much soul	yes but sia has maturity shes far older and more experienced
well they made this hilarious movie called keanu	oh i really wana see that is it good
that sounds like so much fun	it was fun to watch them all like that
do you think eli manning is nearing the end	yes but he has obj to help ease that pain
well anything can happen maybe hackenberg can turn things around	i dont know we got rid of almost every player that helped us get close to the post season in 2015
they really get me going when i listen to them	how is their music
the 350z in tokyo drift	is tokyo drift your favorite fast  furious movie if not which one
i dont think there are any other prominent japanese jazz artists at least not known in the united states	is she very new on the scene
and thats all that matters	at least both albums are good
i would say its an action comedy in the buddy cop mold it tried to be really funny and witty with its jokes physical humor and situation comedy but i felt it was really flat and oddly paced	is kristen bell in this movie shes always in movies with her husband dax
califonira girls was my top hit	i loved the video for that song
no i didnt know that	he wanted to do it so bad he almost bought marvel
its amazing how some arenas can put ice down for a hockey game and then hold a concert the next day	i wonder if that affects the ice quality maybe thats why the rangers havent won the cup in a while
i wonder if theyll bring back the ewoks	i hope so
i hope not it would be awful if we lost our first game to the browns	i know it rarely happens
do you know what their first album was called	it was called magicians holiday and i think it was released in 1974
i mean the idea of the film is a bit generic but the way it was conveyed was awesome	i think it showed just how crazy things can get in a locker room
i always thought they should have gave han solo a stand alone movie	that would be cool like an origin movie on how he met chewy
so those mannings got it going on	those manning boys had the nfl on lock
i love that movie	i know pesci and deniro are amazing in it
i was mostly joking but i do think that happy music at a funeral or wake is the way to go	i think it would be jarring and out of place if people are feeling very sad they dont want to hear some peppy up beat music
yes jodi benson was the perfect voice as ariel	i know she really made the music in that movie so beautiful
not sure it was great talking to you have a good day and remember mariah carey is the greatest singer ever	ah no beyonce is the greatest singer ever have a good one
her voice is great it is has a great range but it is more on the raspy side	i will have to look her up
oh how interesting	the last reincarnation the dog had a bad owner who eventually just drove him somewhere and left him
well i guess it turned out well maybe not so much for han solo i wonder if he will make it through another indiana jones movie	they could try to pass the torch to a younger actor but i dont think they would kill him off
i guess the networks are right annual circadian rhythms fit with the memory span of the average american	i guess so but whats an annual circadian rhythm
yes great movie and great acting	i guess heath ledger as the joker was pretty good
oof yeah i mean theyre honest about the things theyve done and how theyve treated their voices though	true and hey at least theyre still going
do you have any favorite songs	i really like the long and winding road
is that lil john	yes and dj snake he also does another song ill add let me love you with justin beiber
he did great movies  what is your favorite	its got to be big jake
yes ive been seeing a lot of movie trailers lately	yep theres wonderwoman pirates of the carribean guardians of the galaxy and a bunch more
do you remember airheads	yes wasnt brendan fraser in that one
detectives investigate an island asylum for the insane and find not everything is as it seems	sounds pretty good i hope it shows again soon on tv
it is so great you can listen to it in any setting relaxing and fun or energizing and serious	wow the album is both intense and relaxing
hey	hi
what other old artist do you like	their is so many to choose from have you heard of denise lassalle
i used to have it on my mp3 player and would listen to it when i went walking	didnt jay z sing that song with her
they just came out with a new song	i heard it yesterday
right theres the whole scene where hes chopping wood and climbing mountains	yes and drago only trained inside a gym
come on	no
have you heard of ratatat	yeah they are one of my favorite bands
i liked them all the first and second were great though have you seen emma watson in beauty and the beast	not yet i know shes in it but i dont think it would be of interest to me
they actually were  it was like a different world	i just never had time
gabriel landeskog is the captain	oh thats interesting well maybe ill watch him play
i thought atlanta was going to win	so did i
yeah but how does that comment on race	well its not as direct as that a rural or isolated setting is fairly common in horror films of course but its the fact that the movie moves from the multicultural urban environment to a more homogeneous rural one
so you told me mama mia is you favorite movie musicalany others	well yes they are ones that most everybody probably likes
its always funny how they have scrubs for wrs	right but they somehow still come up time after time
high school musical ever seen it	no can say as i have
that is another great song	it gets me pumped
they got lucky besides what did they do last year nothing	nothing except beat your steelers lol
yeah like the title track for instance it starts with this super mumbling choir sound then peaks into full on fleet foxes	and you think its a little jarring i read that in a review too
cool ill add it to the playlist	sounds great cant wait
yeah i guess so i dont like that term	oh okay
what would you compare it to then	ode to joy by beethoven is more like a rock opera written by pink floyd it has a lot of layers
true true did guetta do without you as well	yep thats actually the song that got me started on the 2010s kick
how come	well all this time i thought he was a bad guy only to find out he was really a good guy after all
yeah a golden era in rap for sure there were a lot of songs about butts though	nothing wrong with that rump shaker was always a classic
are you a fan of jazz music	me no not really
we would listen to the radio while we did our homework	right but couldnt concentrate much with the temptations blasting on the radio
is that so i remeber when it first came out on vinyl	wow that was years ago
dodes the girl leave him after that	no because he helps save her brother dominic
same bro	wanna play some music
psycho is basically an alltime classic	i guess they dont usually make them like that anymore
i also saw the vkideo it was off the chain	i know off the chain and long as hell
man i need to go to a concert	why
it is apparently the real lady florence was equally terrible at singing	so its a comedy
that would have definitely helped i was kind of annoyed with how all of the gungans talked	maybe its that whole species that just needed to be redone
do you think she is performing soon	well if im  not mistaken  she will be performing in citifield new york ny on august 28 29 2017
they look so fun	have you ever been
well what do you think about the wonder woman movie in general	i am pretty excited because it is getting very good reviews
you are an interesting fan	it was very memorable
the first one i didnt even give the 2nd a try	the first is the best why didnt you watch the other one
might go to season opener too	now thatll be expensive
most overrated team in the nfl go	gotta be the cowboys
yea he will always be missed	the movie itself was pretty good too
yeah like what about one where the bad guy wins	or what if the whole time the bad guy was the good guy
what did you think of emma watson as belle	i thought she was pretty good she does have quite a resemblance if you look at her and the animated belle side by side
oh antonio vivaldi really championed it rather than having such a huge orchestra a chamber group can play in a very intimate setting where people can get much closer to the musicians	so it was made for smaller venues i get it
a talent for music is obviously inherited look at the marsalis family look at bach	or families can have family businesses such as making music or cars or muffins or teaching math like me and my family
pretty cool ive never been much a fan of football	why not
i love the new despacito song featuring justin beiber	i agree  he was surprisingly good at speaking in spanish
they are ohios other team they are from cincinnati	interesting are the browns going to keep hue jackson for next year
the secret life of bees i have never heard of this	what can they do with black cat the only thing thats fun about black cat is her relationship with spiderman
i like how it teases that there are several layers to reality	do you like its pacing
ive definitely never heard them being called that before	i saw it on a youtube rant  my eyes were opened to the mumble rap artists
only because stupid teens think hes a pretty boy	well theres something else people must see in him
have you watched any of the harry potter movies	i havent but i read the books  did they live up to the hype
hey did you see that tampa bay lighting bolt guy	oh the one that got hit with the puck
i love that girls dress	i made one like that once
are you looking forward to part 2	absolutely i will probably ge the set when it comes out in stores
how did you like rogue one you have seen it right	yes i have and a i enjoyed it quite a bit
the movies are very rich moody and dramatic	yes dramatic is a very good way to describe the movies
hmm i do tend to like a bands experimental stage like if they are talented enough eventually they start to really push the envelope in their own way	true for the beatles i think it was maybe revolver that was the turning point there or maybe sgt peppers
plus swordfights	and pirates
whats your favorite song by him	well my wife introduced me to him with the waitress so im gonna have to go with that
what happen	at the 2015 playoffs some one supposedly purposely deflated the football
im ready for the season to start its been too long	yeah i know they need to add two more games if you ask me
its essentially the same the story though in hamlet you dont get to witness his fathers death	disney is good about breaking our hearts watching baby animals lose their parents
durant and curry are pretty unstoppable	you got that right
they bood the rockets like crazy for a lack of effort	were the boos directed at anyone in particular
well well see what happens this year that is for sure	yes we will  good luck to you even though being a browns fan its usually bad luck
he gave them great minutes when tom was out	yes it is a shame he has to sit the bench and wait
its about these young black boy and his white girlfriend and they spend a week at their parents cabin	sounds like a horror movie to me
that doesnt mean they should blow their entire budget on a rookie	they probably just wanted to get the ticket sales buffalo doesnt really support the bills that way you think they would
yeah i love the fight scenes in that movie they are so original	who directed it
how is that	marsaglia published a paper saying the random numbers fall mainly in the planes in the 60s
cool so you like older rap	i prefer rap from the 90s
oh yeah it was amish paradise	yes thats it what do you think of weird al
yeah but even so i think it turned out really well	if only luke had actually listened to him
i can see it	harry and zayn are probably the biggest ones
right i agree	a movie that can teach kids they can succeed is always important
give me an example	the browns started in 1945 but they were originally in allamerica football conference  the aafc
i watched it mainly because of jamie dornan im a fan of his	what other movies has he been in
he probably starts maybe a year or so away	they need to get some better weapons for the qb regardless of who starts
it was a drug overdose	thats truly a shame
oh really like who	it stars toshiro mifune and takashi shimura among others
yes it is him with the member of no doubt minus gwen	oh that is so cool what do you think of them
i used to love cindy lauper back in the day  girls just wanna have fun	that is a great song  i also liked time after time
do you think hes better than elton john	thats tough
mines rubber soul	ah good one some of there more trippy songs on that album
just hoping that i dont cringe too much and think what on earth did i see in this	haha good luck
the movie	what did you think
whos the youngest nfl player that you know of	its got to be ezekiel elliott if i am current on my players
wow ive got a lot of music to check out im so excited can you rank the albums in your favorite to least favorite order thats how ill listen to them	of course  though thats a tough question kid a ok computer in rainbows a moon shaped pool amnesiac hail to the thief the bends the king of limbs pablo honey enjoy
so do i  lately i cant get enough of million reasons	yes that one is definitely one of my favorites  but you and i is my favorite
it was about a young deer growing up in the forest his name was bambi	oh yes i think i remember now didnt his mother die at the end of the movie
the other day i went to the movie theater and saw the new disney movie pirates of the caribbean dead man tell no tale did you see it already	no i havent seen it did you enjoyed it
have you seen drstrange yet	yes i have
i agree with that to a point  it got a bit heavyhanded	but overall it sounds like you enjoyed the experience
nice its coming up soon then  did you like the older spidermans	no not really
whats the funniest movie you ever saw	blazing saddles ive never laughed so hard
does he have a wide range or something	exactly that he can go from sounding like a maniac to sounding like an angel in a second
oh theyre adorable they are a lot of work one of the hardest parts is naming them and thinking up something cute that will attract attention	so what did you name them
it goes along with how the board games has different out comes	is it a funny movie
it will be showing in the theatre near me june 3	i will like to meet you there on june 3
lets talk about tv show songs	alright i loved the fresh prince song
do you prefer the original superman movies or the henry cavil ones	for me the newer superman films were a little disapointing
i think with the distractions gone like colin kaepernick well be able to have a well unified team hopefully team chemistry builds early	the division is going to be tough with the arizona cardinals reloading and the seattle seahawks will never go away i think the only team that hasnt really improved is the los angeles rams
what no way the eagles are terrible	well then who
there is something about that you like	i like the psychedelic edge of the 60s music
i think he would have down well	but it would have been to close to the wizard he plays in the lotr movies
i hope it is as funny as the first one	i bet wit will be if ryan reynolds is in it

not to sound rude but you can listen to music and do other things at the same time right	i really canti like to play it loud shut my eyes and get taken up in it
yeah but it has just as much drama as it does comedy	then call it both
probably because he isnt well known and hasnt had any time in the nfl	i would like to see their offensive line catch up with the talent of their defense

like you always need your family	exactly
these kids today and their music bah humbug	hope some of them get mad and make something good

the one where she was introduced by joe biden	oh was that the one with the survivors of sexual assault
yeah they could have just done the show with 4 episodes to it	yeah that movie was not bad though
the later songs are pretty good but sometimes get too serious for me i prefer the earlier hits	i can understand but i think the true value of the beatles as the super band is their later music

i know ive watched some of the interviews she given for the movie and she talk about how unnerving it was to play that character	i can imagine i wonder who else they considered for that role
yes and russell crowe	those are some of my favorite actors
yeah he works hard to stay at the top but hes almost 40 years old	he takes care of himself personal trainers specialized diet and all that he could play for a bunch more years even

angus young and jimmy hendrix	those two come to mind for me as well
johnny depp plays captain jack sparrow an adventurous pirate	yeah but what does that have to do with the curse
what do you think about all of the changes that george lucas made to the original star wars trilogy	i dont mind the small special effects improvements but the major changes and ones that actually alter the story i really dislike

the beach boys are one of my favorite all time bands	would you consider them rock music
yea i saw something that said he hit just one home run in april and six already in may	thats pretty amazing hes not a guy known for huge power
that is the ringos theme from the  movie	i dont remember that one
anyways there are lots of other characters which can be removed	i do not agree i mean many of those characters make the whole series more interesting
i think that he was good but ledger was better however now that your remind me that phillip seymour hoffman won that year i am not as mad	phillip seymour hoffman was such a versatile actor id say my favorite of his movies were magnolia and almost famous

she is	i really like that song they did together
the chorus starts off my life aint no holiday ive been through the point of no return	that sounds vaguely familiar
what do you feel is the most overrated ncaa conference in basketball	mens or womens
fair enough but some of them are really good	such as
i think the smart choice is the patriots but i think the falcons will come back hungry and with a huge chip on their shoulder  i also like the seahawks to have a strong season	there are a lot of tough teams and that just makes it more exciting and has me more and more pumped up as the season inches closer and closer
maybe stafford will get a chance to really show what hes got	do you think there are enough receiver options for him
hi there	hey
yeah his lyrics were a mess	you cant tell what hes saying
i like them too	thats great

what is your favorite genre of music	i would have to say rb
it is mainstream but its still wellmade  a european directed it	oh who directed it
yeah i think the spurs will lose to the rockets and the rockets cant beat the warriors even with james harden	i would love to see that western conference final of harden against curry
me too that is a cute movie	what is your favorite character from it
what makes c3po a great comic relief character	it is c3pos interactions with everyone that makes me laugh
she can do anything and make it seem amazing	she is talented more than we probably give her credit for

what do you think happened to tupac	i dont think he was killed  i think he went into the witness protection program
94 million	how much they made
who does it on may 11th	i guess a team who is struggling with their identity
it is a tough genre to exceed in for a while	unless you do standup and stick to that yes

i dont know why they made one song with them	and didnt make their own
thats it i like it too	they play it so much on the radio

like paranormal activity	that one and the second one wow when the baby is all possessed

hey man how are you	quite well just got back from an umphreys mcgee show those guys are awesome
yeah  they changed it weeks before opening the film	i like return better anyway
yes luke will play an important part in the next movie	i thing it will have an impact on reys character

did you watch the braves and blue jays last night	yeah braves looked terrible and now freeman is out
okay i sort of get what youre saying	you should check out other movies that are hard to figure out if youre into that
its been a mix last time it was the remake of the italian job	i dont think ive seen that
the best quarterback in the league is still tom brady in my opinion	tom brady is an old man there is new blood in the league and he is no longer the king of passing yards
oh yeah she was up to no good	the bad guys will never succeed but once i become a mermaid ill talk to you about swimming

what song of theirs did you like	i like the one called  night moves
they had great fight scenes	it was really simple for its time
i agree the whole part about the one armed man was really interesting	right not to mention the twist at the end
i liked it especially when they took their tails and attached their nerve fibers to things sort of like when spock from star trek did a mindmeld	yeah only a little more physical what er the people of the planet called
i hope luke is the strongest ever with the force in the next movie	me to i hope he just kicks butt
and they still had to question if he was the chosen one	i always thought that part was odd
its true that it was kind of simple	i really liked the sequence in the land of monsters though
do you like movies that mess with your mind	yeah as long as its not too creepy
should be doable road game though	we finish up three out of four at home
nice who did they play	the dodgers
so its on to the next round then for the penguins if they get past the senators do you think they win it all	yeah theyve got to be considered the favorite to win the cup
i think that might be exactly it at least the penguins might be exciting moving forward you think they can make the finals again	i cant say for sure but they sure look like they are hot right now
because screen plot was wonderful and it was even nominated for one of scary film	who were the characters
that would of made everything better	i was also freaked out when he made princess leia his slave
yea there are so many good disney movies i need to rewatch them	yea we should do a disney marathon session

the gore is a little much but the comedy was awesome	true i loved the moment when he broke his wrist and told those jokes
cool what does he look like	he is old and bald
you are right the red skins obviously because of political correctness	who else and why dont theses others have official mascots
i know i cant believe that paul walkers brother finished his character out for him	yea i know i could barely tell which brother was playing brian
i wish i could slam dunk like him	he makes it look so easy
do you ever hear pop music	yeah i love pop music
the king and i ever seen it	with yule brenner
boy the music back then was so much better than it is today	it really is
there has been only two alien vs predator movies	oh then i am certain that i have seen both of them
what is your favorite blink song	probably i miss you
yea she is overdue	maybe sometime this year
yeah she could do a show of just singles	what about other songs she has she could do cover songs
i still say they will win the division	i wouldnt bet on it
the way he just kept coming after that poor girl  if you can call her that	yeah and how could no one tell how ugly they looked
yeah especially when your running game was going so well with charles and west and whatnot	you would think that would open a ton of single coverage for receivers to take advantage of
he uses amazing wordplay and imagery to paint the picture	that is good
again like mlb and their 162 games per team per season	exactly i think no more than 20 games max for nfl long enough for a decent season but not enough where games feel pointless
do you like shania twain	yes i love her
his acting style suits tony stark well	i see what you did there
its called boys boys boys and its the best ill sing it if you want	i have to be honest i have no idea who she is is she that girl who wore the meat dress

his latest album reached no one on the billboard 100	i read that too
have you heard the cure	thats her most recent single i didnt like it as much as some others but its still pretty good
i like nevermind	nevermind is an iconic album
did you manage to have any fun at the game	sure you know i like the concession stand food
i dont want to be that guy	there are some animated movies made for kids that i do enjoy however
so what was bad about what he did	well as he might say there aint nothing like killing a man in one line he says hes killed men women children and just about anything that walks or crawls
there are a lot of explosions and i think i saw tanks in the trailer	yea it all went down hill when they lost paul walker
i think pharell recently did some pop work with nile rogers	pharell got in some copyright trouble with that thicke guy for their pop version of blurred lines
lets just hope zaza pachulia doesnt hurt anyone else	i hope he doesnt the warriors always get lucky with injuries to the other team
thats a wide range	yeahi wish i could listen all the time
i like watching drew brees but im afraid to draft him anymore	truth he is no spring chicken anymore a big hit could take him out for the season
i hope that they will stay true to the stories	there are so many stories so there is plenty to choose from
why do you like him so much	he is from my hometown we both grew up in the same place
have you watched the third pokemon movie	the one with entei
well you should give them another try theyre so good	are they even making new music anymore
i was looking forward to seeing a decent western	go rewatch unforgiven

i think it will be the pitsburgh steelers taking on the green bay packers	i like that prediction although i do not think the steelers will be all that great this year
indeed he does he also plays rhythm guitar	i read that he is one of the founders of the band too
have you seen the old horror movie burnt offerings	no but i heard of it is it good
it just seems like it could be something unique	have i ever heard a theremin before
i guess i can give them a try	just keep an open mind even though kids are doing the magic there are also teachers that are adults and some pretty notable actors are in the series
what do you think of porgy and bess	i like porgy and bess but i have a hard time seeing it as an opera
what is the best part of playing your guitar	i love it when i get into the zone of just jamming my guitar to my own tunes thats when i am at peace
mcdermott is for real the team had playoff talent with terrible coaching with a good coach i think that will be enough	if not at least we have that extra first rounder and can get a franchise qb
glad you agree lots of great and catchy stuff on there	heck i even liked the follow up ep we are drugs
do you think it is harder to find good music these days	i dont know i hadnt really thought about it what do you mean
kluber almost pitched a nohitter the whole night	why did he not pitch the whole night
now that you mention it i might have heard that one on the radio who is the artists that sings that song about growing up and being like their dad	oh that sounds like the zac brown band song my old man
what did you think	i was pleased with the win
have you ever seen the departed	i dont think so who is in it
i wonder if dak prescott will improve in his 2nd year	he was really good as a rookie  it will be hard to improve on that
did you know that bob anderson was the darth vader stunt double	wow  his sword work was great  was he in the original
she sings lots of the hits of today she loves carrie underwood and taylor swift	yes they are very popular

no it was foul so he had to run back to home	aw no tell me he had another chance
they took a tight end in the first round i didnt like the pick	could he at least block
oh okay me too	i feel like i know a lot about current music but not a lot about classics

yeah classic sherlock homles  and how he faked his own death	yep just like in the novels
hes a great character	my love comes from frank oz who acted and voiced yoda
i know quite a few girls that like them as well	really  interesting
yeah he plays a bad cop its kind of complicated	thats right its about the crime world in south boston
well i feel like jacksons movie had more spectacle but this new movie just more fun	i did like the new godzilla so ill definitely check it out at some point
oh my gosh i love that song	have you heard any of their other songs
yeah i have to go back and watch that again it was so good	i liked into the blue with him and jessica alba too

hey man the nfl preseason starts up august 3rd	thats right cowboys  cardinals in the hall of fame game
either way management seems to have things under control	yeah theyve planned well
did you feel diors  haute couture spring summer 2017 was inspired	now i thought it was edgy for the sake of edginess
i wasted my money attending that show	why what happened
maybe with a little bit of style and flair not with our music but our costumes say instead of a long dress why not a fur coat say a huge black fox fur coat	wowie you wanna wear a fox fur coat im down to dance with you girl
he also released another song last night that is catchy too	can you send me a few of the songs
how do you mean	well i noticed it years ago when i was running a jethro tull cd through a graphics equalizer
what are you most looking forward to this game	i just want to go out and show the fans and the team that i am ready to go and good as new
well not so fastthey played in the 80s and played modern football and montana rice and lott with that defensepretty tough	well if youre going to consider the 80s how about the 85 bears
yeah same here	mel gibson was pretty funny in it
i think that song born this way  is her most powerful song with a message  although most of her songs have a message of some sort	that
either way its stupid abbey road is the last album	well at least the latest recordings from the beatles
we need some more superhero movies	is their not enough of them
they make good music fergie is funny	gwen was just on the voice shes amazing
the movies are funny and they did good with the special effects	they did do you like twilight
i liked how she teamed up with all the artists to sing	she is a very verstile singer
i kow its super popular but piano man	that one is such a classic
i remember being in middle school and roll out was pretty popular i loved that	yes most of the songs on that album word of mouf were good
and jordy nelson paired with aaron rogers is great	nelson makes rogers all the more dangerous when he is on the field
getting excited about nfl football camps opening soon	absolutely i plan to get to the green bay packer camp in depere wisconsin next month
i really miss 90s rap the music today just doesnt reach me	i know what you mean that was my favorite era of music

its probably the best blaster	i dont think chewy would have given it up
i agree she appeals to so many populations of people	i love how she is a pop singer but she can also sing classical or rock music
its on their album technique which was released in 1989	sing part of the lyrics maybe ive heard of it
i like the mix its fresh	yeah it is pretty unique
yep and that leads him to a down on his luck jack and karina smythe a young woman who holds the secret to finding the solution	but i take it theres a catch
im not as big of a fan of her music now	im not either did you like 98 degrees
it was it definitely was not what i was expecting	i dont think it was what anyone was expecting
luke fell out of cloud city  and yet he lived	luke had leia to pick him up
i will his last single was a great song	i agree it did so well on the charts too
i have never seen this movie	you must get it it is one of the forgotten ones
that just takes money out of their pocket	yeah its a stupid concept
yeah he just looks exhausted out there	it is odd though since his teammates are not that bad
that isnt how music should be made	call him a parody artist or a joker i cant call him a musician
why	becasue he thinks he should be making more money
true he has come back to his original vibe sound and name	so who else has actually fully switched
well i enjoyed talking to you	same
sort of they play with a number of different instruments for different songs and there are other toys too	so what do they learn
yes it should and thats why we should go to the bar to watch it	drinks and football is my type of party
do you listen to fall out boy	no i never even heard of them what kind of band is it
what was your favorite song from the album red	the one called 22
what ever happened with your girlfriend	we actually got married and had a little boy
what songs are you hearing	well mainly old stuff i like lose control
have you ever been to a concert	yeah of course i just went to an aerosmith concert
when will that be	i believe next week
i went to the club the other night and guess what song came on	i think i already know what youre going to say but back that azz up
do you know if princess leia is going to be in anymore star wars movies	she has a part in eight but not nine
yeah see you saturday	sounds good
i would really like to watch it	does dumbos mom get taken away or killed
was she wearing sports attire	she was decked out in classical music gown chic
are any of them still alive i remember when john lennon was shot and killed	ringo starr and paul mccartney are still alive i think george harrison died a couple years ago from cancer
yea you almost wonder if she was lip syncing	yea but she wouldnt
thanks i am putting thunderstruck on their now	that is the ultimate getting pumped song
how many remakes of kong will be made	i just think every producer keeps making it worse
oh thats whythey do play good for the morning	what do you like
such a shame about it	i know
wed be overrun	at least we can shoot them into space and theyd survive
how about other movies playing	i kind of want to see bay watch
it has many different genres combined in the same movie	that is nice
you mean the safety that converted to linebacker	yeah it was a great move his speed and coverage skills are awesome for a lb
i think the spurs are good enough to make it to the finals at least	keep wishing  they are flimsy and prone to injuries
did you see the new beauty and the beast	no i didnt did you
he wanted to be rich and famous melanie is an artist	of course she is but i dont like her art lin manuelmiranda is a musical genius
i prefer the dolphins myself	the dolphins are ok they have a nice uniform ha ha
so you probably dont like keith urban and carrie underwoods new song then	well i dont mind the song on its face however in my opinion it is not country at all
hes a hiphop artist i think hes kind of new	yeah ive never heard of him whats his music like
i hope nobody gets hurt	we will see at training camp
yeah and deshaun watson is my favorite player	haha he played very well
how could i theyre both great romances	they really revived the disney movie genre
of course i do	well turn it on and lets start dancing
he certainly was successful with the colts as far as winning divisions but it only translated into one super bowl win  what year did eli win	2007 right after payton won his  have you ever been to a game
oh no  that wouldve been bad for them	yeah thats what i was thinking
have you heard any of his original songs	yes i have but if i didnt know almost all of the songs from the sinatra time period i wouldnt pick them out as new
yeah  cried like a little baby on that scene theres a rumor going around that theyre planning on a prequel	i dont think thatll work what do you think
green bay minnesota and chicago	yeah thats a tough division
yeah they are like the uks version of fifth harmony	yeah they are a good group
we just saw the new cars 3 movie	really how was it
ill be in boston for the 4th of julythis year	cool and arent you and your sister gong to the new kids on the block concert on july 8th
thats cool not a fan myself	you dont like rap
no the cd was under the tray in the case so people had a hard time finding it	i think i may have listened to it
i think thats why tangled didnt do as well the songs just werent as catchy i think the humor was way better though	why
whatever happened to harmony in popular music	you mean like doowop or the four seasons that kind of thing i guess it kind of went out of fashion after the fifties
i was very young didnt have the chance to see them live freddie died in 1991 and that was the end of it all i would give anything to see a show with the whole band	yeah it was very sad he left this world too early
it is country	who sings it
yeah knowing he is partially a god made me happy	yeah i loved the little groot was super cute
both but seriously i think you should start with goddess its less sophisticated than the altar but its so good	why not start with the altar
i agree	with frozen it has been very effective
its hard to say i think if he makes it through the whole season the cardinals might have one of the better defenses in the nfl	i could see that coming to fruition plus they have bruce arians who for my money might be the second best coach behind bill belicheck
i tell you the wizards really disappointed me this year	why do you say that
he made a comparison to eli manning and lebron james	are you kidding me in what context
what kind of emotions is it about	its main characters are joy fear anger sadness and disgust and they all live in a girls brain
yeah i really liked him when he played for the wisconsin badgers	yup and hes been sneaky good in st louis and los angeles the last few years
why do you think them	they have no quarterback and no defense
so what is your favorite disney movie	that is a hard question probably the lion king
thats good he really is fun to watch	i think andrew luck is great too
was that the only difference between the movie and the actual mission	no the long survivor also said that the injuries suffered by the deceased seals were more gory than depicted in the movie
or think of bing crosby frank sinatra or nat king cole they were incredibly talented and had to work very hard	i feel old saying this but they just dont make music like they used to
i think they just know what they were doing	i feel like you needed to be on drugs to listen to them
well even too much for a musical	i loved the whole thing
were you surprised that they killed off han solo	unfortunately i knew that outcome going in as someone spoiled it for me online
i wish he had kept making music  he was unbelievable	yeah he was truly a legend  there will never be another artist like him
who is better leia or rey	rey
really i hope its true	those guys are too old for that kind of action if you ask me
did you like the music from the revenge of the jedi	yes i love all of john williams music
oh yea i know which one youre talking about now i had no idea that was a remake	sure is and the thing is nobody really knows what the original was intended to be about
a lot of people were introduced to johnny because of the movies	i am not gonna lie but im one of those people
yeah but i think that the broncos can become every good in a few years	yeah no question about that
there is something just beautiful about that whole soundtrack  did you watch the liveaction version	i saw it on opening night
i didnt really like him	why not
best movie is probably get out i need to see now	no i think get out is clearly the best even though im not crazy in love with it
probably not conflict of interest maybe	well all im saying is im sure theyll retire soon
yeah i would definitely consider myself a beatles fan and by that i mean a fan of their music not necessarily the guys themselves	i know i feel the same
okay maybe there are some male ones you can name too	scar shere kan prince john jafar gaston
oh i did too dan stevens as the beast was incredible his costume was by far the best	i agree but we cant forget about gaston
you should check out this internet rapper called pink guy	is he good
yes another great song by her is light me up	it is for sure that song touches my heart
me too	even though they are not that popular
yesonly one time for the cowboys too	thats very unusual
are you a fan of music	of course who isnt
self titled is my second because of biggest lie	that song is my favorite closer
nice i love lana	same whats your favorite song by her
thats fair although i felt that melissa mccarthy received too much credit for her performance in bridesmaids which overshadowed my favorite part of the movie kristen wiig	she was also good in bridesmaids too bad she hasnt had another hit movie since
me too we would sing concerts at recess time	did you like the spice girls too
why is that	i loved her time changer
i think that king triton was too hard on ariel and thats why she was more rebelious to find a way to the surface	she uses ursala the sea witch  they make a deal for ariels voice
yeah i hear ya some of its pretty terrible	you can say that again
why not	because his voice is irreplaceable to me thats just something i dont like for bands to do
i used to listen to it when i was at work and had a stack of paper to do kept me pushing at a good pace	i might try that some time any other songs
what sets it apart in your mind	so many things actually hanks is perfect in it and its such a charming story
it tells a dark story but then the payback is the whole kicker	why they call it sleepers
you will be surprised to hear that i havent watched it yet	what seriously you havent watched shawshank redemption are you serious
do you want to go to their concert	i guess it is still good rock music after all
well if you put it that way they dont deserve to be in the superbowl if luck is their concern	im just saying that they were games last season that they had a great chance of winning yet they came up short
ghost was another great movie of his	yes it was so heartfelt and romantic
that was pretty messed up even more since isaiah thomas sister just passed away	yeah i thought that was weird too
with who dr grey	no she was gentically produced with his dna
i think i will download it whos in it	hugo weaving and natalie portman play the main characters it was directed by the wachowskis
i couldnt of said it any better	didnt they release a movie about that whole situation
i did too	are they any good
she is also very happy with very little she collects trash	i guess they are very similar
out of the original ones i would agree with you  if were talking all of them the dark knight	hard to argue that  that movie pretty much had it all
the action sequences in the films were the best part	yea the slow motion scenes were epic
i am just chilling	bored
i think my favirote eddie murphy movie is coming to america	that is a wonderful movie
one of them matt damon was very good with bow and arrows the other was good with a sword	how did they kill the dragons
the patriots	the patriots are terrible
did you like the chase scene	yes it was very well shot i found myself hoping that the other group would die
yeah	that sounds like fun
most people just want to hear the hits though right	i think at this stage of the game the who is singing old and new songs because this is supposedly their last tour
what about natalie portman what did you think about her as anakins love interest	she was ok the star wars movies that she was in were not my favorite but she wasnt bad
hey buddy want in our fantasy league this year	of course why wouldnt i
oh definitely i will never forget the bellowing noise they made	the cinematics in special effects in that scene were insane
cry sister	that one was alright
now whos having dark thoughts besides i still think happy music would be the best thing	what songs would you pick
have you seen ms sloane	no i havent is it good
oh you mean they lost last night	yes it was close though
how about the songwe cant stop	i love that song
i like the word flow and beats of raphip hop music	i really like hip hop as well
i like 80s and 90s music a lot	oh okay  what are some bands from that time that you like
in that case ive recently rewatched my favorite movies for the umpteenth time	and they are
come on nelly is still relevant in the music industry hes already a brand	lets face the fact when last did nelly drop a hit song that made it to top 10 of the billboard chart
he played khan right	yes thats the one
i am trying to find a good nighttime tune for my baby	let me thinkragdoll blues is a classic
what movie is it	i think it is scream
are you a fan of lady gaga	i am i started listening to her in high school
it is do you think itll be good	well the last two films were solid so id say it should be as well
i know  there are way more than i expected	who opened for him when he was in concert
yeah they came back from a huge deficit	no kidding
thats an old band you dont like new music	no i feel like it has less emotion
what is up	nothing much
what about the rams	nope
nobody will ever beat the joker	he represents chaos
it seems like it is meant to be long and pointy at the end so it will spiral through the air	thats basically true in the 1930s when the forward pass became prevalent the ball became longer and smaller in diameter
you think theyre going to make a sequel	oh yeah  most franchise movies have sequels these days so expect it
one is 8 and the other is 10 both boys	so what movie are you going to take them to see
how do you thing shilling felt after his loss to that kid	i wouldnt think he would be upset but its so hard to get that far with no hits
did it come out in the 80s	no it is much older than that
do you like the newest one the stage	it would be my least favorite
did you like the story	i loved it a bunch of misfits forming a team to take on the greatest threats of the universe
anything else maybe something a little heavier	oh yeah blanck mass album came out a few months ago and it is intense
theres got to be one you dont think is that bad	i guess id say happy gilmore
have you seen any new comedies lately	yes  i just saw central intelligence
good point i cant wait for the finals to start	same here only a couple of more weeks to go
they are great movies	with a great director
i dont either lets change it up again	this is getting complicated want to just put something on from my phone
she has spanned almost 4 decades now	and really since material girl what has she done
oh no hes great i also thought that ron and hermione were perfectly cast	dumbledore too
i would say top 5 would start with brett favre	and then
why is that	because they have better special effects
is it really scary	it might be the scariest movie ever
absolutely he got in the bubble too and covered bowies space oddity	how was that
thats a good time to listen to it	i like eminem a lot
do you listen to the doobie brothers	i have heard of them but i cant think of any songs
seriously did you say the same about kraftwerk or daft punk	nobut their music at least made you think
who is their star quarterback	tony romo is not with them since becoming a free agent
do they even have a record label anymore	well its just one person nowadays
and 80s	the lost boys
did you like the scene in beauty and the beast where gaston exiles her father	no i didnt think that was right he was very egotistical
hi	hey
wow do you have a favorite character	definitely genie
how old was kurt warner	i believe he was about the same age as brady actaully
yeah but its by that singer  you know that popstar singer  i dont like that kind of music  i am more of a grunge kind of guy	well  hey i mean she has many platinum albums so obviously a lot of other people think her music is catchy too
yup tune in at 8 pm on tnt	now its a best of 3 series and boston has 2 home games and only 1 away game
oh okay i remember him i really used to like his music but havent heard any of his in several years	hes still great hes a very underrated songwriter i think
have you seen the new bridgette jones diary movie	no is that the one where shes pregnant
laura osnes reminded of that beautiful blue grey dress that kerry wore in sex in the city towards the end the skirt with all that texture that looks like flowers is so beautiful	i know right i even like the shade of pink matched with the black normally not a fan too 80s but this looked really good to me too
so youve got your dream team what kind of movie would it be	im thinking it would be some kind of corporate thriller
how about the huge ape scene the kid climbed a very tall rock to get to talk to the huge ape	oh right now that you mentioned that was a great scene as well
okay what was youre favorite disney movie growing up	alright slow down are we talking disney channel original movies or you know the classics like cinderella
yes	i wish they would come out with more music
that is actually one of my favorite teams	no kidding they have a very impressive defense
yeah and its dangerous for the players	if they get hurt in the pro bowl then they definitely will regret playing
it was actually i had kind of low expectations but it was great	you had low expectations
yes they were the heavy favorites	what year was that
definitely  if you like superhero movies youll love it	why
i would have to say shes the best vocalist of them three	right her song genie in a bottle was my favorite
oh yeah definitely	i think theyre gonna win it all
i liked the battle on takodana it was epic with lots of actions and everything about it was great	i like the part on jakku when rey and fin were being chased by the first order especially when the milenium falcon was revealed
i remember seeing them on that new years special last year	oh that was the show that dick clark hosted they performed shut up and dance
no silly like which specialty lightsaber	can you give options so i know what youre talking about
who else was in it	well stephen merchant for one thing
did you watch guardians of the galaxy vol 2	yeah i did loved it
have you heard harry styles solo songs	not all of them but sound of the times is popular and is played on the radio a lot
what is this film about	it takes place at an all girls school
well they had to wrap everything up because it was a prequel but none of the characters are in any of the original movies	sure but why not just have the characters ride off into the sunset instead of killing everybody
i think sometimes theres a tendency to think about your parents as parents not as people but they are just like anyone else	i guess thats true i know my mom was a big fan of the beatles
how about one of your favorite songs of his	uptown funk is a good one
thats a really tough question let me think	i know one of my faves was thriller i loved the music video
isnt he in a lot of movies with seth rogan	yes he is in most of seth rogans movies along with james franco
well i like about three rolling stones songs enough to know the words and i can only ever think of two metallica songs	three rolling stones songs huh  maybe theyre just not to your taste
when malfoys mother goes to harry and asks if her son is alive or not	oh yeah i forgot about that part what else happened
like it is not important	but in the grand scheme of things it is
im sure it will be the same yahoo has a free game every day and its always the same as the mlbs free game	sounds like the mlb is desperate
do you like rap music	i dont mind it theres not a whole lot of artists i like though
i probably will although its going to be hard to top wonder womans movie	ill be the judge of that when i go see it
i always thought he might have been made a little too cuddly though	his scenes in the prequels make up for that
i will thanks for the recommendation	youre welcome i hope its a good present
in pittsburgh we expect the win the super bowl every year	if you arent first your last
thats pretty interesting	i reall like bill murray
i like that	its words to live by
she doesnt write her own music so shes at the mercy of her team	she doesnt choose a lot of material that appeals to me
its that time of year again	what time of year
elam kicked a 64 yarder a few years ago right	no that was matt prater denver always had good kickers so its easy to get confused
what song are you listening to right now	this song is called breathe
when the fireworks fly over the castle it just feels so good	i wish i could always feel that way
its a terrible way to treat cooperdougie	i thought he would snap out of it when he drank coffee
one of the best of our times	she really is
did you ever like any of the beatles music	i love the beatles favorite song of theirs is i wanna hold your hand
what about the staff	well the jets have a new offensive coordinator
do you want to come over tonight we could watch a dvd and order a pizza	what movie do you want to watch
well ill see you on sunday and hopefully im wrong about my predictions	i hope you are too bud
it does get pretty intense i dont blame you	i dont know what it is about alien films they seem more real and scare me much more
grunge rock was a great movement	there were alot of big bands like stone temple pilots
yea but who else was even half as successful as him from bacstreet	touche my friend touche
i mean you are right	yeah i totally am
yeah there werent too many bands doing that style at the time	i think set your goals was the only other band in that category
yeah but that was one good game out of the last couple recently hes been playing poorly	i think he has been playing alight i mean the eagles are winning arent they
i dont think top gun has that status	yes it does not
some people think so but noting happened that led up to it	and the dodgers retaliated
right and not just as sideline reporters	though erin matthews is great
well yes but while doing other things and the music itself is special they dont just turn the radio on	oh interesting honestly though im not too convinced
they sing photograph foolin and animal	i actully think i have heard some of those  i just didnt know who sang them
would you want to see it again	a part of me thinks i would but i honestly would rather see the new gardians of the galaxy
yeah we have to touch on something else though	okay what is it
snow white is such a classic movie	i think it is one of my favorites the witch was pretty scary though
ill take heed maybe we should watch it together or have you seen it enough times already	i dont think its the type of movie you could ever see too many times plus theres a great duet with steve carrell and dane cook doing let my love open the door
true every genre can vary so much	exactly i think you were just thinking of b film horror lots of great ones
he did sell a lot of records	his album thriller is an all time great
enough to make you hooked i dont know why they did sequels though	sometimes you want to capture lightning in a bottle
im a big fan of jayz as well but i also like jadakiss as well	jadakiss can always br counted on to bring some fire to a track
i need a good horror movie to watch can you recommend anything new	have you seen get out yet
there was a thriller movie called split that came out last year  did you get to see it	no i didnt get to see it yet  i never seemed to have the time while it was out
ah i remember that character he sounded like woody allen	ha ha yes it was nortons idea actually to have the character to sound like woody allen
have you ever tried true religion jeans	yes i like the length on them but they are most hip huggers and i like high waisted jeans a little better
i like the red trim and the gold buttons	i know they are cute
do you like slayer	yes
anyways i loved talking to you	same
i know grant is just going to coach and stuff	he likes to manage and organize
i guess it still feels weird	trust me on this one
yeah ive been a little in la la land since i saw it	ha ha you liked it that much
i agree its hard for me go get into zombies that run like track athletes	ha yeah if youve been dead dont think youre going to run a 44 40 yard dash
colleges make so much money if you have a good football team or even nationally ranked basketball teams	but most of these amateur programs are money losers commercializing them wont help much
hmm tough to say hope somebody other than new england wins it	yeah im tired of hearing all the talk of brady being the greatest of all time
it really helps when he scrambles  linebackers cant catch him	he picked up tons of first downs last year from running out of the pocket
what kind of country do you like	mainly outlaw country  love me some waylon jennings and hank williams
whats your opinion on bon iver	pretty mixed to be honest
i really loved the johanna song they have throughout such a beautiful melody	it is and is such a good driver in the action  i love the meat pie song
neither team has won on the road yet this series	lets see if the wizards can take care of business wednesday and secure the first away win of the series
like star wars episode i and steward little as much as people hated jarjar at the time he looked amazing like he was really there	i guess maybe were so used to seeing cgi characters now that we just know it isnt really and somehow it looks more fake even though the cgi is better
their death was tragic to the entire nation	it was i wish it would have just stayed with rap and not turned violent
i dont know why they do that	i fell like who they chose to play baby was all wrong
its called the cure its awesome	is it on radio whats it sound like
brady is decent though	i agree no one is like him
have you seen shaqtin a fool basketball bloopers	yes  i think they are great and very funny basketball bloopers
seattle is going deep again though i wouldnt be surprised if they went all the way once all the egos and feelings got put aside	patriots against seattle
hi there baby you listening to music	blah blah gooby do
you wont regret it	ok thank you for letting me know
unfair as it was i think it helped get the artists out there and tour otherwise we may never have seen them perform	i heard prince was the best performer
since twin peaks is being revived i decided to go back and watch the twin peaks movie fire walk with me	oh i remember that vaguely when did that come out
did i tell you that i was going to the symphony last night	no you didnt thats cool how was it
i think they have one super great album	which one is that
have you heard any of lady gagas new album	ive heard a couple of the singles  million reasons and the cure
i wouldnt mind going to a place like that	i think they actually built a bar inspired by the cantina somewhere in hollywood
yes sort of like that the objective is to hit the puck into the net	ive seen them do that
they they had bananas on the record player	and girls all up on each other
please tell me you have seen the movie called homeward boundthe incredible journey	i might have is it old
thats when i feel that the best music was out	i kind of agree with you there but it depends on who youre referring to
hm now that you say that it does ring a bell	oh i remember now it was poor unfortunate souls
yeah but hes such a force physically	no doubt beckham might have the best hands of the bunch
yeah the cast goes on and on	oliver stone did a great job directing that
i thought so too after the first time you hear the phrase	and lucy in the sky with diamonds has nothing to do with lsd its actually the moon the stars and the sun
what did you think about wonder woman did you enjoy it	it was okay certainly better than batman v superman
overall a good movie	whats your favorite
yeah they even changed the end of the the return of jedi to include footage of the new anakin skywalker	oh yeah i remember that see modenizing the old series is possible
yes thats the one about the boston globe feature of the catholic church	yes based on a true story
goodness has it been that long i cant take any more of watching these guys	one more terrible season then it should begin to swing upward my friend
they are great movies	i really enjoyed them
i can understand that	but superman is so cool
hey did you like mulan	who is mulan
thats not it at all im saying tebow was more exciting to watch even though manning is a better qb	how so
alright wannabe smart guy tell me how debussy employed a musical device called pentatonic scales in his creative process	estampes the girl with a flaxen hair la mer etc
what was found out	well he lived in a trailer had a hard life and fought his way to even get a gig when dre saw something in him and took him under his wing the rest is history
why is that	the other two get too digital
cool what are you watching	currently i am watching through the batman series
i agree with the london stuff im not sure why hes so persistent about the nfl in the uk	who knows what i do know is that it takes away a home game for one team a year and puts them at a disadvantage
they arent too bad plus itd be cool to see more international athletes take up football	i just want to make sure that the games arent affected because the players are jet lagged by the trip
that was a good one	he grew up in britain his dad was greek and owned a restaurant
we need some different teams to make it all the way	the nfl doesnt
i would love to see her in concert	does she have any tours coming up
dude is awesome deflate gate or not hes good	true that between brady and gronk pretty much unstoppable
and i loved her comeback songs like womanizer i felt were amazing	that is a fun song its catchy but has a message to relay
i guess	music is life and my favorite thing
do you think theyll make a sequel to zootopia	i imagine so it made a ton of money
i like them too but they are much more mellow than excision	yea to each their own
oh thats not a very popular one	not really but i enjoy the lyrics
lets do it at your place then	i could probably do that they both love the raiders too
do you know about any good contrations the cardinals has this season	i like tj logan hes a really fast rb
so i shouldnt bring up any information about the patriots eigther	oh no he hates bill bellicheck
yep their top hitter was struck out	wow that is so cool
i agree i think they seemed as though they could be close friends	i think she ended up with the right guy in the end
good call	thank you
like i said anything is possible but in fantasy football you should be playing the stats at least to some degree	i am all in
i really did like deadpool it was very funny	those comedy movies are good i just dont like movies like neighbors
i heard that the music in that was wonderful	it was like the first movie they used classic rock from the 70s and 80s
yeah ezekiel elliott is awesome both athletic and personality wise	have you seen his hit on kam chancellor after kam chancellor blindsided him
who are your favorite players	ezekiel elliot and dak prescott make a great team
i have many but at the very top i would say garth brooks	yes he is good i love his song sail my vessel
it seems that no one asked him directly about it	and it seemed like either billachek or the patriots tried to cover it up
they have seven all together	wow that is incredible how many of them are singers
i used to too  now i hear my children singing it while theyre watching it	thats so funny  mine do the same thing
hey football seasons about to start	yeah im really looking forward to this season
i really love the classic disney movies	me too  the newer ones just arent as good as the classics  which one is your favorite
yeah well he incorporates piano too but mostly that	it seems like he must collaborate a lot
honey if you can pull off overalls you can be a fashon guru just go talk to her she needs your advice	well maybe after lunch i could grab some magazines and look through them with her point out some nice new trends
yeah	are they learning to play instruments or what
for sure and the grunge era was profound for us as teens	yeah his music helped me get through a lot as a teenager
yep  same here	it was not until i saw her  explain it on a tv show where i then learned the true words and meaning behind it
yea hes the greatest ever	better than montana
which actor portrayed the joker the best	jack nicholson
i think as these stars get older they become less interested in having a big hit film	i think eddie murphy could make another hit movie if he really wanted to
and leave young talents to explore this industry	yes i agree
it was about three very talented black african american women	oh how interesting what did these women do
seriously this is the sum total of your knowledge	yes like wendy williams says the only way i care about sports is if it collides with celebrity
i was thinking that too on the track kiwi	british screaming rock music all sounds like the arctic monkeys
totally to this day decemberunderground is one of my favorite afi albums havent kept up much after that though	thought they were dead to be honest not literally but the band split or something
no not really	oh okay
exactly it would be perfect for a lot of twirling	i need that dress in my life
have you seen any great movie classics lately	not really how about you
have you seen the movie cinderella	the disney one
oh i dont know about that  practice and the will to win factor in too	well if you look at their past the packers have at least had 3 championships in the last 60 years
oh well that sucks	yeah i was all excited because i loved it growing up and then it just wasnt as good
the second movie of the guardians of the galaxy  no i havent	ok great what do you think about seeing it
they sing rock	i have never heard of them
completely it felt like the old days and it was definitely an experience that you couldnt have watching tv it was the perfect movie for that kind of situation very magical and transporting	was it crowded
whos your favorite actor	adam sandler why
not everything she came up the aisle and the sun was shining the flowers were beautiful and i was miserable	they were playing bach
do you have a favorite album	i really like lp3
maybe they need a change in strategy	yeah i think so heard some people suggesting they try the 14 offensive set
so the movies they play are not enough to keep people paying	i think that people do not sit down to watch movies like that anymore
they write all of their own songs and all of their own music	so they are real musicians awesome
do you want to talk about music	sure i love music
you know that scene from beauty and the beast where lumiere starts singing and dancing during dinner	oh yer i remember that now
are they going to fight harder if it is drews lasy year	an intreguing thought

okay one of the best is family affair	not sure if i know that one or not
youre not serious are you	what my brother knows what i like to wear
okay	i like the braves
okay but how can you enjoy the traditions while listening to those silly voice dubs	those dubs are actually done by a british company called omni productions who did many of the voice overs for martial arts movies as well as godzilla films and even some anime thats why you hear the same voices over and over in those movies
did you know that sometimes he had to play in small cramped studios with very limited drum kits	i did not know that that makes his playing all the more impressive to me
it absolutely does i believe there is another star wars film coming shortly too	awesome i love the franchise it is so great that they have brought it back
they sure did not seem to give lovie smith much of a chance to be successful there	yea he was fired rather quickly i thought although dirk koetter seems to have been a great replacement
i need to get some new movies for the kids i am so sick of watching the same minions movie over and over	have you seen any of the studio ghibli movies
yeah i know what you mean for what about four years now by the time they get to the play offs theyre pretty beat up	its pretty discouraging they win their division every year and then they fizzile in the play offs
thats why i like it so much it really pumps me up	i also like her song kingdom come it inspires me a lot too
maybe rey is the missing key to it all	daisy ridley is awesome as rey i cant wait to see what she has in store for us
what is your favorite star wars flick	star wars episode iv – a new hope the one that started it all
what movie did you take the kids to see last weekend	my son was really interested in the power rangers movie
yea he had a great college career as well	i feel that him and sean payton have been a perfect match together
it was  my mother was really mad when i put it in a garage sale years later	yeah parents get real sentimental about stuff they get you
agreed it really is like a work of art those planets and scenes were images created from a blank slate	its incredible what the human imagination can come up with
im sure youll love his music and youll meet a lot of cool friends even his family and band members will talk to you	sweet thanks for telling me about him
well are there any classical compositions that you especially like	hmmm i like beethovens fifth symphony and fur elise

when you hear that song does it make you think of the show	yes it was played during a sad part
do you have any of michaels music albums	i have bad xscape and one night in japan

youtube is a great source for guitar info people show you chords and stuff	i do watch videos on there sometimes and i try to play along with them
who is your favorite star wars character	han solo
yeah but female rappers make it a point to never be lazy	thats true azealia banks is another one
do you like really smart movies	yes if they are entertaining
i dont like when certain movies make sequels theyre not as good as the first	agreed i liked grown ups and grown ups 2 though i thought the second was better
youre right i cant even remember any of their names	i wonder what nicole is up to now
even running across the nation	yeah and he named all these famous things just by being him
and hes still alive	that takes talent
thats how it is for me too with places i remember	what movie  or book  did you hear it in
yes i did	thats good
no who	dallas cowboys which happens to be my dads team
i cant believe that i love her voice it is incredible	i know she has a great range but i just do not like the tone
sure thing	well what type of team do you prefer in the nfl
what about drake	drake is not a rapper in my eyes from what i hear he dont even write his own stuff
uhm theyre not really built for dancing either	yeah you might fall and hurt yourself
it is a really great movie	why is that
that is the pixar film right which one is that about	a bunch of different emotions inside a childs mind we experience emotions having emotions i think
yeah can you believe it	what  has she lost her mind  that was crap
thats true the older movies have a kind of appeal to them	the old set have a kind of nostalgic value
i just love music	same it is always calming
i think a lot of people feel that way	watching the nfl players tackle each other brings a rush to me
now they have some cute colors	true but i refuse to pay that kind of money for what looks like a small box hanging from a strap
yeah this movie centered on what could be going on	i dont know i think we agree to disagree
well henry wills son is trying to free will from the curse of the flying dutchman	the whole 10 years at sea one day shore thing
what is she	she is just something unique
nothing but total respect for him even from the current players	in another couple years he may be headed to cooperstown
i want to go see alien covenant	ill go with you
true even if curry or thompson arent playing well durant and green can take over the game	yeah it helps that durant doesnt rely on the three as much
definitely recommend	i so rarely go to the movies though theyre so expensive here
i loved mission impossible	yeah that was a good series top gun was also not that bad
appreciate it thanks man	no problem any other good pregames to look forward to
reptilia was such a good song i hope they have another track like that on their next release	i hope so too i am sure that albert hammond jr has been working hard on new songs
i understand do you think that order will ever change	i think so
i like the sequel better actually it is set in washington dc	i like the sequel as well wha other reese movies do you like
it is unless youre the one being called onstage	haha yea i could see that being a problem
really	oh yes i think there has been a gay couple shown in a show recently
no its not  rush is a pretty popular band whose lead singer plays bass	rush is one of the best bands ever
what is an interesting fact about your team that most people dont know	buffalo changed to their iconic red helmets not only because they were badass but because quarterback joe ferguson was color blind so with four teams in the afc east having white helmets at the time pats dolphins bills colts ferguson was struggling to separate receivers from defenders
did you ever watch the aristocats	i loved that movie as a kid
what music genre do you like the most	i like heavy metal but i also like salsa
rookies can make a team but its hard	yeah new blood is good
thats too bad i love their music	me too they have tons of classics
i think so too	yeah i mean hes done it all
i havent listened to their more recent music i like their older songs first day of my life and bowl of oranges	oh i remember them now i used to listen to them all the time in high school
well then i live under a rock	you sure do why do you bring her up
what  you cheer for the likeliest looser	thats right
so which of his albums do you like	only all of them im serious
i agree but i dont like the sound	fair enough which ones do you like
isnt that like screamo yelling music that sounds like guttural noises and barking  how can you listen to that	i agree the vocal are a little ridiculous but i actually listen to it for the instruments
yeah thats it	why do you ask
why you say that	because his lyrics were always whack
what did you think about the movie effects	that at least was the best thing about this movie
yeah that is the one	that is a good romantic comedy good call
really how was it	it was fantastic the acting was really good
i wonder if her kids will be seeing the movie	me too  imagine seeing your mom as wonder woman on the big screen
i saw it years ago i loved it	thats awesome ill have to go see it
is that what the oldest daughter sings to her boyfriend	yeah but hes just a friend at the time
nine  i thought they won every time they played  how many super bowl trophies do they have	five
what it any good	i thought she did a really good job yeah
oh i think i have heard that before	what is your favorite genre
oh interesting	yeah
its weird that theyve gotten so popular with that type of music why do you think its happened	well with file sharing services i think bands really have to offer something extra in order to get people to buy their albums
did you see future perform mask off with kendrick	yeah kendrick really stole the show
not bad	good
what do you think about the mandela effect  concerning star wars	i am not sure i know what you are talking about
i hope to see them play at the park this year	sweet
you and me both	id say thats pretty universal  definitely prefer her stuff now versus before
good  do you mind seeing the movie twice	no i would definitely watch that movie again

have you ever seen spaceballs	no why
im sorry you must like them a lot	i do they are my favorite
fourth quarter four yard run	who made the touchdown
yeah it was too long in between and the jokes and situations did not seem plausible	jason biggs still couldnt be that awkward with women
thats right theyre on a reunion tour right now	its always so nice to see groups reunite i loved xscapes song who can i run to
naw man that doesnt matter that they dress with tight clothes they got banging beats top notch production sound you havent heard before	maybe they do man i dont know i may give them a try
yeah i dont play his stuff any more though too goofy	do you play classical at all
sometimes they would play the majors in exhibition games  the negro league teams usually did very well in them	many great players never played in the majors due to the color barrier and racism  it was nice that the hall of fame devoted a wing to the old negro leagues and some of the great players from that era
definitely one of mine too	i hope they come out with more
i never had a sister so i was never exposed to it	its actually not too bad pretty good songs
snape how come hes the meanest character in the whole movie	im not sure why im drawn to him i just feel like theres more to him than the eye can see
is music a good topic to talk about	yes i love music
the original predator was a classic	yeah i think that it is one of the most underrated action movies out there
that was the crux of my argument too when you take into account his dominance that number didnt seem right	he had a heck of five year run but that probably isnt enough
i completely agree martellus bennett is an animal	yeah and dont forget about lance kendricks either
do you remember de la soul	of course  breakadawn was my fave
she is a pretty lady with good music	i like her style shes cool
i like the giants a bit because eli manning is on that team	why does that matter
boo was so cute with her pigtails	i know i was worried they would get caught
hey what was the last movie you watched on netflix	i rewatched forrest gump the other night
i cant wait for the new tool album	me either  honestly im not sure its anything more than a rumor
well im a huge fan  like a serious lifelong diehard fan  and i just heard theyll be playing a secret show downtown next week so im going to try to get tickets	wow i had no idea you were such a grungerock girl
lets talk about nfl football	okay cool

do you recall super bowl iii	not really it was before my time

i get it	i hope hes coming back
how do you feel about neil diamond	well he has not done anything in a while
i dont think ill ever get tired of those minions	they are way too cute
nice and fresh and fun	yeah they did a really good job with that one
yes some of the actors had never acted before	it is a good movie
oh really like which ones	well he did a tv movie called duel a long time ago with dennis weaver it was one of his first films
this new band i found	what are they

johnson persuades diesel and walker to go after a bad guy in exchange for amnesty	same old  i hear letty turns up
he really is convinving in his roles	yeah and he started on a soap opera
im pumped about the new nfl season im interested in how the teams will work out this year	yeah i have my favorite teams

what are you trying to say about kelly olynik	that he is terrible at basketball
they are studying it and piss it off then it kills them all	interesting what does the life look like
its about an utopia for animals	yeah sort of a reflection of humans
i think deadpool being rated r took it to a new level   i could just do what they wanted to and didnt have to worry about being too child sensitive	i think deadpool 2 will be funny also i cant wait to see it
yes it has been to long and ben is gettting old	may be time for a change
haha i know i love him in national lampoons vegas vacation	he is funny in all those vacation movies
did you see the one with the cat	noi missed that onewhere was that one
i know but its like our entire world series team has been totally dismantled and not replaced with anyone good	oh thats not true we still have our 18 million dollar man whos hitting 150 he probably has some other injuy again
i wonder if they will do justice to the original	i doubt it
yes he was blake sheltons advisor	oh thats cool
im sure aqua teen was way cheaper to make	yeah but even so a venture bros movie would cost way less than something like minions or finding dory
did you know that rihanna was in the movie home	who is rihanna again
what are you talking about	most of his music is for singers with piano and maybe a small band but always piano
what is your favorite music	rock
chucky hes a doll	yeah thats why hed win theyd never see it coming

did you ever see the eagles in concert	no i always wanted to
country what about you	i like country too and hip hop
yes  the arguments the celebrations and the heartache too its a real insight	what team do they follow
that movie was so good	it give you a perspective
ive been listening to them for years  its supposed to be funny not offensive	well to me its offensive  ive never heard of twiztid but if theyre anything like icp i dont want to hear them
do you know the farthest fieldgoal in the nfl history	no i do not
i do not got the money for that	why not
the indians would have won	yeah
thats mine too	i cant wait
that sounds like fun what would you want to see	how about beauty and the beast
whats on your mind	most likely the fact that theyre just renovating it for the jets
i agree johnny depp is stupendous	i think he is perfect for the role
devils night is a good song to watch the video on youtube	ill look for it

have you seen any of the movies	yeah i like darth vader
did you know that mark hamel went to my high school	get out really
boooring i was always a fan of messier	i suppose he was good those new york teams gave people something to be proud of when their basketball franchise struggled
do you have a team you like	i like the hoosiers
all their songs do sound very similar	yea it is almost like they distilled it into a formula
me too what about you whats your favorite band	i dont really have a favorite but ive been really into smash mouth lately
i think i like the japanese ones better  the matthew broderick one was a mess	the writing was really bad  dialogue didnt make sense
i dont really like talking about politics  what is your favorite radio station around here	wish i would have  have you heard of any good new movies coming out
yes i saw him doing that     catchy and pretty surprising	yes i never really thought any of them could actually play guitar
did you like it	yeah i thought it was decent
you know keep the footages and just add more modern touches	if they have the green screen originals then i guess thats possible
yes it is very serous	ok well jeeze i guess james cameron
oh wow that is a hard choice i guess id have to say anything can happen	what do you like the most about it
ha ha thats what i think but yeah i love stuff like john williams music or james horner or older stuff like henry mancini or lalo shifrin	yes i would listen to them ive just never really thought about it
she was a great singer and ab souls girlfriend	kendrick used her well in the song too
yeah  a lot of 80s bands tour now	yeah i saw that skid row was touring recently
have you seen him in crazy stupid love	is that the one with ryan gosling
yes	well thats pretty cool to know
patty jenkins needs to direct the next superman movie	wonder woman had superman vibes all over it
she does have very unique songs and videos	yes she does and very eccentric taste in fashion too
what kind of music do you like to listen to when you relax	usually something classical i really like yoyo ma
i would probably start off with the way of all flesh	that sounds pretty intense ill have to check it out
yeah theyre the kpop group  it was pretty exciting to see them win	what did they win
who else have you been listening to	i have been listening to justin beiber
no that was neil young too crosby stills nash  young	i think youre confused
gary cooper could hold his own against anybody	i agree hes good but not on horseback life after westerns is a different story
van halen was a really good eighties band	yes they were
if you had to choose what would be the best movie death of all time	wow thats a big question i think it would have to be sean bean in fellowship of the ring
yeah it should be a close game	hopefully both teams will have a better season this year
is that more than when we were kids	yes they added some teams since then
what are you talking about i still sing that song all the time	i know i like singing the kristen bell parts
nightlife is probably my favorite the beat is amazing	you know i am a sucker for a good beat
i gotta go	man want me to come to
have you ever wondered how many species there are in the entire star wars series	yes i have im guessing theres probably over 10000
the original is better	much better and much sadder
i like baby pink and candy pink balenciaga has some beautiful spring pieces in pink	pink is very trendy this year
did you enjoy the new star wars at all	the force awakens
yeah i would have picked la la land	me too
i dont think thats true	sure it is look at his album sales
i do enjoy some of his lighter work too like pineapple express is pretty funny	it is the ultimate stoner film but great
and theres a lot of them in that movie	thats true but after a while you dont notice
could you explain what you mean	of course  it marked a real departure from the rest of their catalog and an evolution in their sound
were you ever into the back to the future movies	wow i loved those
kevin hart is a funny guy	well you have to watchc it there are so many funny parts
i loved chrissy teigens dress too	i know and john legend in his white dinner jacket was a nice accessory
i will watch them today	will you have time
classic heist movie with a comedy treatment	something like that but of course most of them are really dumb or not too forward thinking at the very least
yes he does and i believe defense is the most important part of ice hockey	im thinking of signing my son up for ice hockey what do you think
so i usually will read all the lyrics before listening to an album for the first time and then read them again while im listening	i do too except there are some songs i just cant find the lyrics for anywhere so i end up understanding about one more line each time i listen to a song
cool i like abbey road	that is very innovative
good question they must do a great job i hear it has been on broadway for a while	well lets plan to go
i have to say i love ralph fiennes	hes so good as voldemort and a lot of people didnt realize it was him
thats terrible	why
i think they can win the division though	me too but there are better teams that will defeat them in the postseason
have you ever seen the classic taxi driver	yesrobert de niro
i agree i listen to it all the time	i wish she would put out new stuff
its great to see an organization going in the right direction	yeah it is they just have to make the right moves going forward
i dont know about rich but during the singoff they went to the home offices of the trevor project which is a suicide prevention nonprofit that help lgbtq youth	it is nice to know that some people arent corrupted by fame and use their platform for good
im just kind of getting sick of these two and a half hour movies  could have cut a whole 30 to 45 minutes from the thing	agreed  i think zach snyder is a bit selfserving
as long as they put an actual line in front of him this year  that injury was gruesome  yo think hell be ready for training camp	i dont know  the way the league tries to rush these guys back from an injury    im thinking rg3
very true	it was great talking to you
do you think vertigo was a good film	yes it was so suspenseful
i agree i fell in love with that version since i bought the anthology	thats the best version
what is your favorite ben stiller movie	thats a good question it has to be either be zoolander or meet the parents
why didnt you go	her concerts are expensive like crazy and for piano recitals the seats to the left of the stage sell out instantly
yes aaron rodgers is a great qb	he has some nice players on offense to pass too
they are from nashville tn	anyone else you could suggest
youre right maybe they have a baby	nah that wouldnt be funny
do you think certain colleges get looked over when it comes to the nfl draft	just like any sport certain colleges are more recognized in the sport and others not so much
didnt know he had that many	and a lot of them were bad one too
yeah i do too	its good to have a disney movie without a prince charming kind of person
yeah i could do that but what do i do if they pick cars 3	maybe you could say that the tickets are sold out
did you see the great wall	no it looked pretty cheesy to me
we can go tonight if you want	alright that sounds good what time is the show
what about woody harrelsons character he was like the weirdo on the fringe who liked to count the number of floors in buildings	yeah he didnt last too long though anton made sure of that
i think a less violent game would deter many fans	yeah what would be the attendance for a flag football game
like who	maybe the broncos even without peyton they are still strong with damarius thomas and other strong players
i was just wondering why they chose him as the lead role	i know frasier did such a swell job on the other ones
so what song do you like on there	doctor tarr and professor fether and the cask of amontillado are both superb
exactly her pink tunic with her silver jewelry would of been a better combination	her pink shirt its has too many ruffles ruffles are so ugly
whats your favorite christopher nolan movie	im a huge nolan fan so this is a tough question let me think about this for a second whats your favorite
i need some new albums ive played out all my current music im bored	ive got melodrama by lorde on repeat i mean its lorde everything she does is magical
just letting run straight up the middle	um no thats one of the best ways
no i was just wondering what your response would be to that	i think they are a solid team
ha even i could run	umm yeahno  lol
why do you say that dalton got hurt last year right or was that the year before last	it doesnt even matter they have no leadership
what other players do you like for oakland	i like amari cooper a lot ive been following him ever since he was at alabama and i expect good things in the future from him
new jersey	oh ok they sounded like an international band
what do  you think about pop music	i generally steer away from it as it appeals to a bland undeveloped musical taste
well yeah itd be fallacious i get all that but im just trying to poke fun	while joking about it is a lot of goff hate i also think right or wrong there is a perception that goff is unintelligent due to his guffaw on hard knocks
okay he is good	right
miley cyrus definitely fell short	yeah she seemed good at first but then she went off the deep end
boba fett he was always my favorite as a child i was so bummed out when he got eaten by the sarlacc pit in return of the jedi	oh yeah he was everyones favorite back then i think such a cool character even though he wasnt exactly a good guy
rock maybe a hint of folk or blues thrown in	sounds interesting do they sound like any other groups out there
now they seem to be pitching experts	i mean you have guys with sub 2 eras that lead the league each year
so guess what they came out with a new transformers	what are you serious didnt make enough of them
but overall it was a great movie and i think it realistically portrayed the rap and hiphop culture	i guess it did  so it had some social value as well
do you like the drop kick murphies	yes i do  isnt that a requirement if youre from boston
so far ive only heard good things	a friend of mine saw it last week and really liked it
that was a very good summer song	this song definetly reminds me of summer everytime i listen to it
what style of music do they play	their style is a blend of music called jazz fusion
whats your least favorite kind of music	i dont really have a least favorite kind of music
well kingsman for one	with the guy from pride and prejudice
classics	totally i used to listen to danzig too
speaking of underrated next would be ty hilton  hes been in the top 24 scoring for wide receivers every year hes been in the league	i like it  im going to take aaron rodgers next  might be early for a quarterback but he is great
true the base of starkiller is mostly a fighter battle with ren and reys saber duel inbetween	yeah but it nowhere near as epic as obiwan and anakins duel on mustafar
im just awful at it every time i try to improve the music im listening to i mess it up	what exactly are you doing wrong
and if you have any trouble let me no and i will try it for you	ok i will do that thanks again
they had another album out a few years ago right	yes they did it was just called the lumineers
who else if anyone is in it	i think ryan phillipe
as oppossed to the masterful lyrics of today	im not comparing it with pop music  i just said that i dont like their lyrics as much as their music
yeah even if we cant call him a musician we can call him a success	he is definitely one of the best parody artists
i think this one is 8	wow eight fast and furious movies
i feel like thats part of the fun of going to the movies though	thats true
have you ever listened to the beatles	who hasnt  i love the beatles
he played a funny role	it was a bit campy in all fairness
platform sandals look good but make it hard to walk	i agree good old flip flops for me the most comfortable
i didnt realize it was that many	yes the browns lions texans and jaguars have never even been to a super bowl
bob sanders was a beast	yeah he was great when he wasnt injured
i actually liked his version better than the original by wild cherry	i remember him auditioning with bohemian rhapsody and how he blew the judges away
why do you like it so much	it was one of the first animated movies i ever watched and the story is pretty good too
i have not seen that i loved the animated version and was worried i would not love it as much	i loved the animation too believe me you will not be disappointed
what do you like about those songs	i like the instrumentals the most and the vocals
i saw this thing years ago with rihanna saying she was influenced by destinys child as a little girl	ahhh i feel old now
what music have you been listening to lately	i have been listening to 2 chainz
hootie and the blowfish	what did they sing
the landscapes were gorgeous	they were the narration was of the highest level as usual i also liked how young girls can related to moana as a strong family oriented character
you mean the emperor	yes well i really like him as both emperor and senator i find him compelling
i think so he also invests in things too	what kind of things does he invest in
aint you joining me to the presidential rally tonight	dont think so anymore sandra bought me a movie ticket for tonight as well sorry
yeah such a tragic storyline	yeah but at least anakin found his way again before he died in return of the jedi
well dont be peele obviously has talent	which is why i think this movie is going to be great
she was fantastic like the part was written for her	i kind of like her
i like that song a lot actually	it was okay
what film do you think has a great dance number	i really liked the dance scene in get smart
whne she sings it you really hear her anguish and what the song means to her	interesting
i think around 5	ok cool well its a 2 hour drive want to leave at 1

i have not heard that one	you probably have you just do not recognize the name
have you seen them all	ive seen all of them except the last one
yellow sub all night long	sounds good to me
its starts as a romance but its a pure action movie i was surprised when i found out ben kingsley and anthony hopkins were also in this	wait i didnt know ben kingsley and anthony hopkins were in this
have you seen the saints roster for training camp	yeah it looks good i think brees is going to have a great year
tom brady has gotten helped along the way too	what do you mean
didnt she win some grammys	shes won all kinds of awards  shes not called the queen of hiphop for no reason
what is your favorite beatles song	thats a tough onei used to like ill follow the sun but there are so manyyou
yes he is easy on the eyes for sure	robert downey jr always does an amazing job as tony starkiron man
thats a tough one  maybe arizona or seattle	dont forget houston texans jj watt should be back and hes a killer
how many nfl teams are there	thats a pretty basic question i take it you arent much of a fan
oh you havent seen star wars before	no i never got into it so all the characters are new

i dont think many songs try to do that	im just saying sometimes its cool to just have a simple beat and catchy lyric
the cubs are going to have to step it up as summer approaches	maybe they can make some trades that would help them
they should do good this year	yeah they got alot of talent there

exactly hopefully we are good this year and next draft is the key we need to build up the oline more	and we need to get a stud runningback
me too they are both so sad	and heartwarming at the same time
sounds like some angry music to me	i agree it sounds angry but its really just about expression of emotions that so many try to avoid
what do you mean	many hip hop producers come from an impoverished background
i just got a bunch of really good rock the other day	what did you get
i was always a huge fan  particularly kaiju movies	you mean like godzilla
yeah it has been one of those  oh no we play the patriots late again this year  almost every year	if its not the playoffs it seems you guys always meet in the late regular season
he such a good chance character	and a great friend
it has become a cult film	i know that and stand by me
on top of that they have gutted their entire team	who did they lose for this season

ya i really like how outspoken he is speaking of belicheck is anyone going to be able to take down the patriots in the afc this year	i wouldnt bet on it but i do like the steelers
ratt	wow now thats some old 80s hairmetal i got to see kiss which was cool
well as much as i like emilia clarke i dont think the script allowed her to exercise her full acting range	agreed  i hope that if they do make another one she gets a second chance as sarah connor
basketball is my favorite sport	i like basketball too but i think hockey is better
me too	i liked the sport the played
and you know bautista is not going to stop flipping bats	no way  theres almost pressure on him to flip his bat now

so who is your favorite band	i think my all time favorite is the pixies
who are your favorites	you might say i like older stuff like wu tang and tupac  what about you
yea i think washington is good too they have some superstars	yea i think so too boston is well balanced but none of their players are elite
exactly and then a few years later it gets more complex but takes on a melancholy i cant stand and its not really rock	you mean like eleanor rigby
fantasy he reinvented himself	and college dropout is when he started
no nor me  i like my legs in one piece	what a classic treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee
thats for sure	what do you think the nfl players bench

you dont like hedwig are you serious	well shes kind of useless
you know who i really liked	who
this may be a semi rebuilding year for the skins	i have faith in them turning things around
what about george i feel like hes underrated his solo songs are excellent	true what is your favorite solo song by george harrison
youre probably right i would put prince and george michael on that short list also	oh i totally agree prince is more rb though
what do you think would be the top as far as romance movies goes	there are the almost cheesy but cute ones like those by nicholas sparks
arent they a hippie band	yeah my brother told my mom that id come home smelling like pot but that doesnt mean i smoked

i think she received some awards for that song	some of her other work is great too like burn
i saw the magnificent seven last night on dvd	the reboot
look at his college experience he was great	he also had a great running back in ezekiel elliot
who is your favorite female character out of all of the star wars movies	i kind of have a soft spot for leia she is just a classic
pittsburgh finally scored a touchdown in the third quarter	when did the vikings score
i love them	same here
what do you think of his beats and pace of his songs	thats what makes him skrillex nothing is quite comparable he brings the beats better than anyone else
you talking about nelly	yeah thats him what was his hit that all the women liked
what do you mean	stopped drinking and doing drugs
that is funny that scene was so impressive i also loved when vader came on board	that was my favorite part of that film  it was so good the lighting the drama of it just so well done
thats really good to know what kind of people go to their concerts	oh just about everyone kids teenagers adults and even older adults that arent just there to take their kids
how do you even dance to rock music	you bang your head up and down
pat summerall and john madden	who did the halftime show
and when he puts on the tuxedo james franco wore when he hosted the oscars	i also like the part when theyre trying to exorcise jonah hill the things he says while hes tied to the bed
have you ever seen back to the beach	nois it new
so they try to control it make it about sex and money	yep thats what it seems like to me anyway
ok i have heard it referenced before	you should check it out they still tour off of the album

anastasia was pretty good too i remember good recall	thanks  what were you thinking
the art of drowning and black sails in the sunset	what kind of music is it
yes there is even a human relationship element to the movie	ok that sounds like a complete movie
thats too bad at least weve both got the wild right	definitely are you coming over later to watch the next game
noeminem	no oh how come i didnt think of him
yes actually i thought the cowboys had a chance last year to win it all	yea their playoff experience was too young last year
check out green onion  fab	i will who else should i try out

have you heard miley cyruss new song malibu	i have and i like it
i want to update my wardrobe with some spring pieces soon	me too i was looking through vogue recently reading about the new spring 2017 trends
you must not want to live to the fullest like in the movie	i guess not
i know  for instance sultans of swing makes me think of that horrible day we had to evacuate because of three mile island	lets think of more
they are really swinging the bats well	ya they have to ride the hot offense while they can  there pitching is not very good
im an orioles fan myself they have been playing well	i saw that they lost yesterday though
beats me i never figured it out but he drove through a mountain	wasnt christopher lloyd in that as well
yes i remember her performing live with keith urban	she was on with brad paisley too
do you think it gets repetitive	sometimes but it also can be very varied
thats my favorite too	i love depp
they took music from really low level musicians who werent well known and didnt have their music out there so know one knew	oh i just googled it yeah apparently coldplay changed the songs just enough so know one noticed for a long time
who dreamed that up she was awesome	i love the scenes ill never get tired of them
yeah that was great he peaked in those years	he stopped being that kind of guy and tried to mature
incredible  george clinton is amazing	atomic dawg
me either i think i may pull out some of my older cds of her	yea that might be all it takes to turn your day around
how do you hear the singer with all that noise	well the idea is that the singer sings along with the music they are integrated together
what about the video game	yeah the game was just like the movie and it made it a lot of fun to play
i think it was even better than the first one mike as a child was so cute	oh i know he was the cutest little monster i loved seeing younger sulley too
what is the sound	very ecclectic
hey how have yo been doing	ive been doing well how about you
im so ready for next years college season	why do you say that
oh really i didnt realize they won a super bowl	yeah thats when hank stram was their coach
a lot about the state of americaour current politicians race relations wealth divisions and more	not just party music is it
yeah that got into the courts and some players were to have been found to even committed perjury i think  it was really sad	sure for quite some time there were so many players that suddenly came to camp looking like the incredible hulk  it was in all of the sports to some extent  you cant really blame the athletes too much as they all wanted to achieve stardom do it better and faster be stronger to dominate
just looking at all the new movies coming out these next few years are going to be awesome	i havent really looked what good ones are coming out
i think a good target for the team next year would be 95 points and a second round appearance in the playoffs but they wont get there unless they trade rask	youre out of your mind rask is a top 5 goaltender in the league
do you listen to country a lot	yes i love it
what do you think was the best era for raphip hop music	id probably have to say mid 90s
did you see the hobbit trilogy	no i am not much one for prequels

im taking you to a movie	is that a date
do you enjoy watching nba games college games or both	i enjoy watching nba games more but i like watching march madness college games too

is she a big fan of the movies	she loves them mater is her favorite character
yeah the patriots patriots i remember when the bills were near great four consecutive superbowl appearances	all lossesi think they should have won at least one of those
a true villain yet funny	and elmore leonard supposedly said it was the best screenplay ever made from one of his books
do you collect action figures or merchandise by star wars	yea everything from posters and old toys
i know that part gives me chills	also the soup puke was pretty gross
i wonder if hes influenced by yelawolf	yelawolf did that country rap album
bombed so hard even with really big names attached to the project	yeah you see michael fassbender and think that whoa this might be good
i guess i can work on that	then you should be good to go
hahahahahand it was a lot easier to walk across the street outside the studio than go to mount everest	yesthey were a little lazy about that
that was a great song so was raspberry beret	i love that one too
i just like being able to binge watch without having to keep notes about which side im on	youre putting too much thought into it
i think the new ones are coming out in 2019 and 2021	that is still so far away they already announced that
i love toy story  i liked the third one	honestly i like the first one better
was it more of a super hero movie or action	more action he wasnt with the xmen
but george lucas ruined the original series to try to make the prequels better	no he owns them and made his original vision a reality after years of being patient
the new ones	no i hate the new ones
all the time i loved how the movie portrayed each emotion as a character	and our brains as like a theme park the memory orbs were really cool too
i could see the raiders breaking out this year	true solid team at every position
i want to go see 47 meters down soon it came out recently	what is that movie about
do you like lady gaga	i love lady gaga whats your favorite song
yup and hes still doing his thing today and he does different styles of music	i think it would be cool if eminem did like a southern rock song thing it would blow people away
i know what youre thinking  whenever they remake movies the new version is never quite as good	that is exactly what i was thinking
bad romance	i am not familiar with that one
i think its supposed to be funny there was a dragon or something	i liked the originals but youre not selling this to me
sure it is its themeandvariations	kind of his music is very add and there are other issues as well
why didnt they call that icing then	there was no icing
so did i but i never heard anything about a new album im so excited now	i cant believe its been 11 years since her first album was released
i watched frozen on it	did it look different
who was your least favorite character	there was no least favorite all the actors did a great job in true lies
me too	what do you think of them so far this year
just thought you may have know it due to the film	no  sorry i do appreciate the recommendations
he is or was	what did you think of the plot
have you seen that disney movie beauty and the beast	the new one with actors or the animated one
i think that the dead thing in the station with them is a representation of the horcrux that was living inside of harry	what do you mean by a horcrux
i think we all had moments of fear like that as children so they certainly played on those fears i could really identify with teresa palmers fears as well as the children in the movie	i liked how they actually had a background story on the ghost haunting them her background story was pretty good about how she was a friend of the mothers and wouldnt let go of the mother played by maria bello
and we cant forget i want to hold your hand	of course not since it is the song they played first on ed sullivan
do you know much about the nfl	a little why
do you prefer her older music	yes just dance is one of my favorite tunes
that is hard to say though	right because they are different eras
are you a fan of will ferrell movies at all	i absolutely loves his movies
oh thats terrible	its called chronic traumatic encephalopathy
he would never make money from helping people	do you think some how they will bring peggy carter back in the film before he leaves
they will remake anything for the mighty dollar	its a shame  lets just hope its good
i can understand that	not to say i dont like wu though theyre still a great group
well when i was a kid i really loved one hundred and one dalmatians	i remember that one clearly too it has such a great villain
what do you mean it is awesome and exciting	i get that but sometimes it can just be a bit much
are you ready for the upcoming nfl season	are you kidding  less than two months til preseasoncant wait
a little fantasy and action put together	they do real well with those movies they keep you on the edge of your seat
like an actor singer someone like that	oh jeniffer lopez for sure
yeah same here	cool
or we can pick one that you havent seen yet	yes thats a thought what did you think of
think itll be fun to see those teams go down	yes itll be nice to see the next generation
who is their quarterback now	the lions are led by stafford who averages over 4000 passing yards a season
and this girl doesnt have the confidence the original baby does	i dont know if i want to watch it
yeah  getting older is not a good look on him  what were your thoughts on mandy moore and jessica simpson	i was team jessica until newlyweds came on and i found out how dumb she was
i think so im not sure about the bengals	well it looks like the packers might have their hands full this year
i like some of their stuff like help and love me do very catchy	dig deeper eleanor rigby is a good one so is norwegian wood some of their lesser known songs in my opinion are better
oh cool	yeah my favorite player is tim williams
whatever well see what happens when the tournament starts	youve got that right
yeah i reall enjoy traveling to foxborough to watch the preseason games	yeah there is something about just my team work out the team kinks before the regular season
101	i know it was insane

i cant wait for the new star wars movie to come out	me neither im so excited
hey the kids want to watch moana	we just watched it yesterday and this morning
oh thats neat	yeah sadly john and julians mother got divorced when the boy was five after that julian says john didnt have much contact with him
i think stan is a really good song	i think its pretty good but not the best
there is a local team near me that we always talk about going to	you really should go its a great time
so that influenced whether you liked them or not	not really it was just cool that i grew up from where they were raised
so that they can get ready for the real series against the warriors	i agree with you this was fine tuning for the cavs
they just dont assimilate and play as a team	the lions have been pretty bad since losing calvin johnson and their quarterback is kind of weak too
i think its originally an elvis presley song	oh right i do think i know that one
electronic is usually too exciting for me to do homework too	actually i listen to really chill songs theyre repetitive and mellow
cousins is pretty popular as a nice guy and all around good player	do you think theyll trade him to the 49ers like the rumors have been saying
so the yankees are his landing spot	unless washington does something
i love the end with them at the park with the gate	yes thats like a fantasy
i get that beyonce should have won the award but becks album was great	morning phase oh for sure
what song do you like of his	something about the way you look tonight
easily who do you think the next great quarterback will be	i think prescott or carr they are both looking very promising
i think hip hop is just popular rap	isnt most rap popular
which ones	the original 3 and then episodes 3 and 7
can not wait for the first game to start already	hopefully its a good year for the seahawks again
yes thats an amazing record as is the selftitled and the black album	ah yes i forgot about the black album i need to spin that one again soon
i have no idea  maybe just because the idea seems corny	i dont know  the critics can be so harsh sometimes
what kind did you get	i got the thigh high boots and i got some clear pumps to go with my all white dress that i also purchased from them
though who would not want more in that case  disney is great at creating a fantasy world you would love to be	some storylines i would not want to be living out though so much peril in some
probably because tom brady has been in the limelight for longer	that could be it
what song is it you wanna hear	free bird
no it came out around 2011 or so	wow ive never heard of it is it a thriller
will it be a sequel picking up where the first one left off	i am not sure there has been talk that it will not center around a theme park at all
i just find them refreshing and different  i enjoy seeing what is to me an exotic locale and how the society differs or is the same	isnt reading subtitles hard
where in las vegas will the who play	they will be playing at caesars palace the same place brittany spears and celine dion played
really i really enjoyed it i thought it was so funny and relatable	hmm maybe ill give it a try who else was in it
yea that would probably wear on you after a while	i dont think im ever going to want to build a snowman ever again
dad what is your favorite disney movie ever made	i would have to say aladdin
i seen once upon a time in venice	oh who is in that
i wish i could be super hero	that would be super
why you say that	carlson palmer cant win the big game
houston is kind of fading out they have another quarterback this year dont they	i think so they change quarterbacks like i change socks
how do you think the beatles got their name	i think it had something to do with the fact they really liked buddy hollys rock and roll band the crickets
the guy definitely deserves to play at that level	he is a first ballott hall of famer
what do you think of popular music these days	i have mixed opinions
then you have beethoven	another classic composer
thats the next one i listened to the opening song all we are was really powerful	its a great song cheerful and strong at the same time
thorragnorak with chris hemsworth apparently a lot of other people like me cant wait to see it	why are they all posting online or something
who is going to be the breakout star this year in the nfl	i think you need to look at the rookie class for the next breakout star
ive looked for years for the thing there was a big train wreck at the end of the movie	do you remember any of the actors don quixote came out in 1605 i think worlds bestselling book
thats cool so do the extended versions match up to the books better	yeah kind of
oh she was amazing now she was totally believable and she is beautiful too	what about her love interest
one of the best ones  and best friends with harrys father	yeah him lupin and that rat peter  i hate him

sure they have a ton of youtube music videos that you can sample watch mirotic to see the 5 man group and keep your head down to see the duo	ill take a loot at them thanks
you an old movie that still gets me	what movie is that
but the panthers offensive line is so bad	yeah but he can catch passes too
that would be the most patriots thing to happen	yep exactly they never miss a beat its just next man up with those guys
well the first one was pretty good why woudnt this one be	uhh because sequels always suck
yes but in the new version the glow is more realistic in the original version it looked like a cartoon	i think both movies were ahead of their time and had amazing visuals
hi	hello
katy perry is so beautiful	she is she is like the perfect person to be a pop star

is madonna still creating new music	im not sure  if she is she has to hold some record for her longevity in the business
what movie should i start with	you should definitely start with interstellar
who can beat golden state for 48 minutes 4 times out of 7	nobody thats the problem
did you like the gungans	they were mean to jar jar
i agree from the slow teasing scenes to the abrupt jarring scenes	they always know exactly what music to employ to set the scene
it seems like the book is always better than the movie	well thats usually the case no matter what
she has a good voice	she does it is very sensual
i like that he brands and gets his hands dirty	he even uses a gun
i definitely have such a shame what happened to him	yeah i agree
hes been terrible i know youre a bears fan but you have to admit hes one of the worse quarterbacks in the league the past years	i know the public perception of him has been bad and the bears record has been awful but people forget we play in a tough division

i have sen that one	a pacino is superb in that one

did you ever see mulan	no never heard of it
that is very true never thought of that	i wonder if disney drew directly on joan for this mulan character plot
why are you thinking so few	well they did do some improvements on offense but they didnt do anything to improve their defense
he absolutely made that movie for me	well it was good on its own
i dont know if even care about that	normally i dont either but they made it all look really nice
because they arent on a major label	no because they arent radio hits
true plus i always want to see johnny depp	yes me too i heard that he appeared in person at the pirates ride at disneyworld pretending to be a character statue of jack sparrow

i saw some old videos with lady gaga on youtube when she was normal	yes she started as just a piano player and songwriter
are there any disney movies that you didnt like	i tried to watch alice in wonderland but it was weird
the progression of the songs really gets me too	what do you mean

sam smith he won a grammy back in 2015 for stay with me	nope never heard of him who else was nominate that year

it would have been a once in a lifetime sort of thing you feel	i feel you on that
i like harry of course	okay
kind of she is searching for her parents and in the meantime gets lost from marlin and nemo	are there any characters from finding nemo in it
she was wearing the halter neck the open back and the flower details make this look sophisticated	she was looking sexy
why do you like return of the jedi more than the other two movies	it is because it is the final showdown between luke skywalker and darth vadersith lord
and my friend guess you and me and leslie	ha whos leslie
what is your favorite will ferrell movie	no question anchorman
they certainly have and country music images have gotten more involved	what do you mean

most rappers now adays are one note	do not get me started
yeah crazy how the guy has a hole in his cell wall and no one ever notices	yeah coudl you imiagine havign to crawl through a mile of sewage
what do the vocals in classic metal sound like	hmm most classic metal bands have singers that dont do a lot of noise making or screaming but more operatic type stuff
whens that coming out	about a year
well they should hes incredible	okay okay what else is on it
they are my favorite bat  ive tried so many others	same here  theres nothing like a louisville
i really like his bass groves	yes jaco was very talented and ahead of his time
who else do you like	marvin gaye
yea something about them being cops and being put in prison together	yeah i think they had to break out

yeait really took a hit on the team	yea they were crushed by the marlins right 70
really did you like they way the action was sequenced in that one	i did i thought it was a bit over the top sometimes but the actin matched the story line well
thats because she was a drug addict	yeah better to be the pusher than the user
do you think the steelers will take the division	depends on how healthy their players are
no but the lyrics are usually very long	i love bands that tell full stories
i saw one back in 1980 in germany it was awesome	really why
yesandthey addded hisalabama teammate ryan anderson	he would give them insurance on the edge
they need to do sword in the stone as a live action	i doubt theyll do it
that sounds pretty ridiculous does it fit the movie	it does you have to see it and you will understand
how do you throw away a 213 lead though	i know right all you have to do is play a really conservative defense and you should be fine
now who do you listen to	i dont since i think music is no longer music but moraless amalgamations of crap
the problem is i think he finally got tired	it sure looks that way
nah i dont think so at all there were a lot of very pretty animated scenes	some of them were definitely enjoyable to watch
well i hope she gets rich in later roles	i am sure that if she stays healthy she will get well paid eventually
you could see him be a bit more serious in that role but not overtly	yeah he mixed it up and by the time it was over he went full on
its funny shes a british girl and had to do a southern girls accent but clark refused to so a southern accent it you listen he has no accent at all	hey thats right captain butler has no southern accent i never thought about that
yes that was hilarious my favorite part was when the did the magic show and no one had a clue they were doing real magic	oh yes that was classic thats something i would have totally done if i were them
yes  ive had interesting conversations already with a few people you should check out the albums who knows you and i could have some interesting conversations as well	wow i actually look forward to doing that
both of those guys are great quarterbacks	hopefully they will have great years
oh atlantis is a good choice i forgot about that	my best friend exposed me to it and its quickly become one of my favorites i found the sequel to be extremely disappointing however
if i buy a decemberists album for someone i like ive usually picked the crane wife since i feel like its pretty solid and contains songs that show a pretty wide swath of what types of music they like to make  but	but what  youre going to loan me a different album

who was your favorite character	mooshoo was so funny to me as a kid

dennis hopper really did play an evil villain	yeah his performance was quite haunting
right and then yoda suddenly says i cannot train him and at that point you realize it is the person luke has been looking for	empire strikes back is by far my favorite star trek movie and that scene is part of the reason why
did you know she was heavily into the clinton bid for election	figures she seems so unhappy about everything
whats your favorite type of music	i know too many i guess i like country
thats is funny okay  what was second or most impactful at a young age	i think my second may have been new kids on the block
ah the beatles some solid tunes but can you say overrated	yes and i can also say wife beaters shouldnt be martyred
maybe i will go over there this weekend and check out the sales	oh i know i love the music sales
its called annabelle creation and its about that doll thats possessed	did that come from those conjuring movies somehow
i remember that that was inspiring	yes it was
no what in the world is a babadook	the babadook is a creature that appears in this fictional childrens book the main characters son wants her to read to him except it starts appearing in real life
nope not one thing	well i am sorry man
anyway need to go but nice talking to you	yeah you too take care
i think the panthers are going to pull out a better season	me too
yea that sounds a lot like what a group of scientists or officials would probably need to do in that position	exactly so its maybe a little slow but you get sucked into the story because it feels like the real world they have to deal with nervous officials a terrified public and the pain of the memories of how their country was effected by the last major attack on them our nuclear bombs
maybe theyre in cahoots and hell take over with palpatine dead	maybe i have a good idea
just buy a ticket	i will

bet you cant guess who voiced bb8	a sound board
do you wanna build a snowman	that song was good too

i am she has some really good songs	i know right i like her a lot too
yeah we could also include go shorty its your birthday everyone loves being sung to by 50 cent	yes thats the perfect addition this is going to be an awesome playlist
do you like dresses	yes i love fancy ones especially with sequins
like rolling stones or led zeppelin	yeah i mean i know who they are just not really familiar with their music
that film is so awesome	i agree it has so many amazing scenes

you know what else was awesome form them too	what
yes i have both of them on dvd	i enjoyed the sequel but not nearly as much as the original
what was the main idea about poker face	poker face is about sex money and gambling
a human and an alien get stranded on a hostile planet and have to learn to get along to survive	sounds interesting is there a lot of action
and what about tom hardy	my hats off
thats an odd choice	the colts are my team
maybe well see a double feature	that would be fun
and talented	makes a good game even better
those are some nice choices all classics in my book	its funny how certain songs can bring you back to where you were when you first heard them
i think i saw it years ago  i completely forgot about it	i love the movie  its so funny and got sweet scenes
dont tell me that you didnt like christian bale as batman	eh he was okay
yes that was scary  i guess different strokes for different folks when it comes to horror	yeah i think it was visually creative with pinhead and those other guys
how so	well first of all its a lot more real and true to life
oh why	well i guess im just too much of a fan of the first two movies the girl didnt work for me as the newest terminator robot
not quite  see the guy is actually really super talented and a great composer	so whats the video about
are they any good	yes they are not as good the patriots of course
i was having this debate with my cousin and he says spectacular now was such a superior movie with shailene woodley and miles teller	i think i liked perks of being a wallflower a little bit more logan lerman emma watson and ezra miller had such great chemistry and they all had really good character backgrounds and growth throughout the movie
i like iron man so iguess i was supporting him wha about you	i was rooting for iron man as well i just love robert downy jr i think hes a great actor
how come	because they are not original and they have no substance
i wonder if any two finals teams have ever entered the series with undefeated playoff records	it has never been done if it happens this year it would be the first time in history
well he shouldnt have shot his mouth off on a playoff promise	yeah but he only had two seasons
wow thats the first time i heard that	they only played a few chords and didnt have much in terms of lyrics
can you help explain to me why the emperor dies when darth vader throws him down the shaft on the death star	ive wondered that myself it seems that the jedi and sith could survive almost everything
you should come over and listen to some music with me	that sounds like fun what are we gonna listen to
what makes inside out so great	it depicts how emotions work inside our heads and i think it is quite psychological
sure	i love southern rock  probably my favorite
i see dead people	a dank meme for sure
ok i see what youre getting at yes cooper is the more well rounded of the two	agreed but john wayne is definitely better with a ten gallon hat and a set of spurs
really	yup just like in most movies composers give each character their own theme
oh yea that was a long time ago though	i know but it soured me on the team
ill pay you whenever the tickets come in	alright i just want to let you know theres also other tickets for this other play in about a month
great yeah i really like that guys voice	bret michaels
me too	my favorite is the force awakens
i can understand that but to just make a blanket statement like that	i doubt shell never tour again i do expect that shes going to take a really long break
thats cool whats your favorite fact	well the green bay packers won the first ever super bowl
who do you think is better wide receiver marvin harrison or reggie wayne	marvin had better stats  so id say marvin
that is true mike vick was a dual threat in atlanta	that guy could run the ball
who do you like	i like frampton
do you think they deserve all the acclaim they get	i didnt grow up listening to them  i started listening to them when i was an adult and i think their songs are really good
yeah he is going to seriously create some matchup problems	plus with greg olsen still in his prime the offense will be unstoppable
yes i have heard it is going to be just as good as 1989	that is what i have heard too it will be hard for her to top wildest dreams though
if you could have one pet from a disney movie what would it be	baloo from the jungle book
dont let me down is theirs too ive worked out to that one before	me too i just really like that i can get lost in the rhythm
yes it was	how about maggie may
last year	whats it called
oh i just listened to them  they are amazing who else did you see at coachella	radiohead even with all the sound problems
what you dont like arron rogers and his hail marys	well he is impressive at that for sure but no i dont care for the packers
who are your favorite nfl announcers of all time they dont necessarily need to be current	well i have a special place in my heart of john madden he sort of opened up color commentary to a whole new level of fun and insight
best movies ever	i think so
thats true but ive been disappointed by zac efron in the past	really
finally got around to seeing one of them the other day dont get what the fuss was about	i mean theyre pretty good kids movies i guess
was joe montana playing back then	yes a very young joe montana
this is good information ill have to check those albums out	i agree and i think you will like them
yes but you would also have the battle tanks after you	what i dont understand is how did the power remain on at flynns arcade for all that time in the tron legacy
havent you watched finding dory yet	no im dying to how was it
like what	justify my love music things like that  it got a little electronic
its one of my favorites but i still like umi says best	that song is really uplifting and sweet makes me miss my grandmother
i cant wait to listen to the new album again	me either  imagine dragons is one of my favorites
no not yet but i thought i would ask you about it did you like it	oh yeah it was awesome i really like it when the movies kind of take dom and the team all across the globe it really gives the stories an epic adventure kind of feel
i think it is like the 19th biggest media market or something	i think that the nfl wants a team in london
that is true i head that alive was for adele adele rejected it at the last minute	oh well i feel sias raspy voice is more suitable for the song anyway
do you like pop	it is just okay for me
no one kessler perry and getzlaf are pretty good	perry is a shell of himself anymore
that sounds like a strange party most of the parties i go to play pop or hip hop	yeah some of her music is more upbeat but her older stuff is sad country songs
have you seen any good movies lately	yeah i saw the wave
me too and destiny chill always makes me feel floaty not sure why young folks need ecstasy  the music is really intoxicating by itself	agree did you ever see the love parade in berlin
anyways wanna go to the game with me tonight	you wanna know what sure why not
its a stupid premise thats why	its a cute baby whos the boss why is that a stupid premise anyway lets watch the new alien movie that seems violent and spooky and all around good makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside with all the alienhuman deaths and ghoulish images
do yourself a favor and watch the empire strikes back	isnt that his debut film
exactly fisher was all about the air game like he had a few picks that were the entire show	that is no way to run a team
do you have any plans for the weekend	i think i may stay home and watch some of my favorite horror movies
well yeah but i mean there had to be some people off world when the planet blew up right i mean everyone couldnt have been home at the time	i mean i guess so so whats your point
nfl is by far my favorite of the major sports because every game is very meaningful	i totally agree baseball for example is way too long  you dont need to watch every game
actually i prefer their 90s albums the best  keep the faith was my favorite	that was a good one i remember the videos were all over mtv at the time
hes the best head coach in football	i cant disagree with that
yes he is  he released two new music videos called i luv it and new face	thats cool i had no idea  i didnt realize he still did music
have you ever given it a chance	nope why should i its all the same
what do you think about rap music	i like it okay
thats true but its just sports cities get alone fine without them	thats probably true hundreds of cities dont have sports and theyre fine
how are you	doing well  how are you
i agree i seen all of them	the new ones chose an aging actor
of course he has a great voice and was well suited for maui	i cracked up with scenes with maui and moanas chicken could never get enough of those two do you think they will ever come out with a moana 2
i think they are all great and their intonations are on par with the others but out of them all in the look factor i think sandra park is the cutest	they are all pretty hot but i have to agree sandra is hella sexy
oh that makes so much more sense they kind of have a british accent	yeah they do do you like them
i do not know	man i feel sorry for them
sometimes depends on the movie though	well i thought brad pitt did a good job in moneyball
oh well i mean like in general in the mlb today	oh i like madison bumgarner
no terrible actor	hes only the highest paid actor in hollywood right now
yea with so much going on in the world today i would love to be able to listen to one of his songs about all of the madness	no doubt about that so do you have any other rappers that you you like
i lole how a bunch of her songs tell stories	me too
i have not seen it but plan on going to see it  i liked the first movie quite a bit	who plays in it
i remember now they did a great job	yes a great job at acting stupid
hey so its summer time	yes
exactly	and by the half blood prince we saw why he seems to dislike harry
i think they were for paid copies	well either way they made a ton  that shawna girl must be so upset
yeah those are the best characters really	i like the villains a lot
i hope hes in it  he died in batman vs superman	well we know he didnt die but the dc universe doesnt know that
i liked the learn me right mumford and sons song	i liked that they used gaelic songs in the film
yeah and theres no cussing in that one either	i guess you need to think twice before you listen to rihannas music
thats true i think both dresses look beautiful given each individuals style but i personally like jessicas better	yea i guess if i was to wear one i would probably wear jessicas i think theyre both nice though
i would say a lot of americans know about them	then maybe they are not very famous in my neighborhood
i have tickets to a few this year what about you	nah unless you have an extra ticket
losing 4 super bowls in a row	thats crazy
do you have a particular team that you cheer for	yes i am a huge tampa bay buccaneers fan

well the ducks won	really i wanted to see that game
hey man did you check out that warriors vs spurs game earlier today	i sure did it was game 1 of the western conference finals and that crowd was going crazy
well theyre all by the same director actually	well then i guess i do have a favorite movie director
have you ever been to one of their concerts	yes and it was amazing they played for over three hours and sounded so good
yeah i dont see disney making that movie	her partner nick wilde sees the whole thing and has to lie for her
well wouldnt tourists come out to watch a football game	not really because they are not loyal followers of the home team
i agree with that im going to see it in the theaters	i might too now
i feel like talking basketball	yeah me too
you should come over and watch it later i have the dvd	i definitely can im intrigued at the movie plot
wait was it the sequel to the force awakens	no it is kind of weird i guess its just a story that takes place in the same universe

i can quote almost every line from jay and silent bob strike back	dont get me wrong i love those films too i even love clerks 2

id say cars 2 is worse than cars but yeah its definitely on their low end of the quality scale	this one seems to be getting better reviews though
what last car movie you seen	cars 2
yes i have  i really like that song	well that is one of many songs that he has wrote  you will have to check out his work sometime
or if you are a division opponent	yeah so you are put at a disadvantage
yes  i doesnt seem like theres enough time to sit and watch too much	i still think the games are exciting  i just watch more for a team to win  i dont pay too much attention to most of the players
yea totally what was your favorite part of the movie	watching schindler change and become a savior to a lot of people
well dont people complain about the rock station	thats the weird part weve never gotten a complaint about it
are your kids still into frozen	well they are starting to get out of it
i will admit i thought that maybe this was a real found footage movie by the end	i did look up the characters and actors too to make sure it was just a movie
oh really is that the one by pixar	yes i love pixar and all their animated movies
there was sort of blood all over the place but there was a montage which signified that the criminals did take time to clean things up	that sounds kind of unrealistic how are they going to be able to clean blood out of a cabin wasnt it made of wood have you ever tried cleaning anything out of real wood
i hope you like it	thanks now i have another great action movie to watch

the part where her dad gives up power just so she can have her voice back always gets me	disney movies always have an emotional scene
jose altuve is really good	yeah i think he is an all star i just hope the rangers make it to the wild card
i loved a cinderella story	with hillary duff
thats right	do you enjoy live music
i thought it was allegedly the genie saying something inappropriate when he was a bee	i heard that one too i think it is a little bit of a stretch but i can sort of hear it
did you see what the phillies did yesterday	what was it
i remember that they had an outlandish appearance is that the right band	yes they look different  the singer wears a crownlike headdress
mutual friend what do you mean	i mean we have friends in common
did you know that micheal jackson had his first solo hit when he was just 13 with the song got to be there	no i did not know that though i do like his work with the jackson five
no maybe about it	i think somebody should remake you
thats true	nice talking to you
i miss the good old days of cartoons	what kind do you mean
daniel radcliffe is such a baby in the first one in terms of looks that is harry the character has always been somewhat brave	i think hermione granger was always bravest
who do you think is the greatest quarterback in philadelphia eagles history	well i am too young to remember normal van brocklin people say he was good for the time
dont know if i could sit through that	they would catch your interest if you kept watching
oh i bet youd rather her watch toy story	yeah just overall more fun  and nostalgic with the toys
the characters are all well done but the cars are the stars as far as i am concerned	as long as they keep topping themselves with those stunts they will have a fan in me
pat mahomes will be in there sooner rather than later mark my words big arm throwing deep to hill and kelce	thats an intriguing visual but as a rookie qb those deep throws often end up directly at a defender and hes a gunslinger hell try it and fail before he learns
sanchez is starting soon i think he can turn the team around	oh ive seen all of the st louis games
what is it	trolls it looks very family friendly
have you heard the remix for black and yellow	which black and yellow wiz khalifa or damian
i loved roar and dark horsewhat were your faves	i really liked by the grace of god and double rainbow
he has a great voice for country  i heard he writes alot of songs for country musicians	he does write alot  ironically his song tennesse whiskey is a rehash from the 80s
i used to listen to that song all the time	what about you did you listen to any of their other songs
that is such a great song do you remeber by any chance when it came out	it came out i believe in 2012
it was awesome	what did it cover
for sure nothing more fun that going to a nfl game with your friends	just let me know what the price of tickets are and i will pay for my seat
worse part is that he is smarter than that	he gets locked on to antonio brown too much
have you ever been to a music concert	no i think they would be much too loud for me i wouldnt be able to enjoy it
yes and the sendup of the despot kim jong il in his underwater lair like some bond villain was just falling down funny	totally i remember him singing im lonely wonewee in that hilariously awful engrish as one of his dispatched political victims floated in the water outside the window
i know it was the first movie that really broke away from the book	of all of the movies i think that goblet of fire was the one that should have been split in two
i didnt know that im going to have to look him up	you should he participates in gift exchanges and everything
no its actually going to be a thriller  very serious	whats it about
see yah there man	see yah
ha thats true maybe this will be theyre year	yeah i always think that right around the 3rd or 4th game but by the 10th game im usually brought back to reality
yes	there are over 1000 genres of music
yes i agree except i wasnt able to really understand it	oh youre not alone a lot of people did
what is your favorite movie	i like the revenant
i think if youre a bad singer singing can be a fun way to get better and just have fun with friends	i suppose
the only dark spot is the fast  furious franchise that has been a drag for several movies now	totally im liking these more under the radar films anyway like the guest
which team do you think is the favorite	honestly its really hard to say  i mean everyone is leaning towards the warriors
so that last album you heard of hers was the self titled one	pretty much
good	cool  were supposed to talk about music
i guess they thought their marriage would last forever	oh they broke up
edward norton and matt damon both do a great job in it	matt damon is one of my favorite actors of all time
i know he wasnt very good	remember all the times he said yippee
i dont think i trust that	yeah me either but i definitely think it will be this year
kpop is like pop on steroids and it sounds like its made in a computer	so why have singers at all
im pretty sure carey wasnt in it id remember that much	it doesnt sound like something ive seen so
what is a penalty in basketball	a type of penalty would be traveling
do you like the band krokus	who
yeah the bears and the jaguars round out the bottom 5 with 3 wins apiece	but there could be a case made for the jets to be this years worst even going 016
sure that hard to choose	yeah i just have so many favorites
ill admit the defenisve backs worry me	yeah me too especially safety after hyde it is very thin
i think another crazy scandal was obviously the deflate gate	i dont recall that one what was it again
led zeppelin 2	coom are there any other albums by them
oh how was that	it was fantastic
theres a youtube channel called grammatically correct rap or something	sounds like something id love
you mean like older rock music	sometimes i also like older rb music from the 90s

i love that movie	johnny depp looks so different in that one
have your been to the movies	only the oldest she went with some friends
the las vegas raiders does not just roll off the tongue	it just does not sound right

you like mystery movies right	yeah is that what this is
whats your favorite disney movie	i like aladdin
what is the first beatle song you remember hearing	i want to hold your hand
you ever see friday the 13th	i believe so the one with jason and the hockey mask
well the qb reads the outside rush and if they bite on the run and move to stop the rb he keeps it if they move to sack him then he hands it off	it sounds like every play should be the option i have no idea how to defend against it
i love wall i just think he needs a couple more guys that fit into their system	i think he is fools gold im going to say that wall never wins a championship
i like obi	they are both so wise
oh i hated her	thats sort of the point
but they have no defense	they dont need defense their offense is that good
yes basically theyre still touring and just put out a new album revolution radio in 2016 but yes thats the green day i mean the grunge band that got big in the 1990s	i see in that case i suppose my feelings about green day are ambivalent at best why do you ask
what rap music have you been listening to lately	i have been listening to kanye
the lion the wardrope and the witch	no never heard of it

i remember watching the talking heads on saturday night live  do you see that	are you sure they played on snl  i dont remember anything about that
the genre is rock but it doesnt sound like anything you hear on the radio its very good	ill have to listen to it sometime
it definitely has the foo fighters sound but i wouldnt compare it to anything else that theyve done	awesome i love cutting edge music
i didnt know that was him	sure was
plus there are some jump out of your seat moments	right with the raptors in the kitchen
then they finally started to play some football remember	yeah it was kind of funny i thought
ive never heard his stuff after american idol	its very rock and roll his album was the real thing
oh wow	yeah if you put in troll 2 on youtube youll see a ton of hilarious clips and reviews about it
oh and remember when beavis and butthead used to do the commentary on music videos	beavis and butthead rocked
i like how they worked jason statham into the story and he eventually became a good guy	yea probably  i think theyre going to have a story where jason statham is part of the team in fast 9
starting with gilbert grape	that was a stellar performance
do you like the animated version or movie version of the jungle book better	to be honest i have never seen the movie version
ok coach im sure you know what youre doing but my son is missing a lot of shots	yeah ive noticed he just has to get used to playing off wing
what is your favorite cash song	ring of fire actually written by june carter who became june cash
have you seen his new music video	no what is it called
why does he want to help the poeple of akir	he simply wants a proper meal which he hasnt had in years and a place to hide from all his enemies

what is your favorite album	i love the one called the fame
im fine with them making a ton of money as long as they keep a small amount like 500000 a year and give the rest to charity	im the kind of person who would make that a law you want a mansion on your 20 millionyear salary but wont give up a small amount of that to house the homeless

oh the rapper	yes  he had a role in the movie
do you think princess leia will be in the last jedi movie	good question id be surprised since she passed away but i would love to see her included in the cast somehow her story feels unfinished
what makes her music unique	she has a lot of diverse musical influences  black sabbath to david bowie and shes able to melt all those into something special
so what is it	a down is like a play if you play four times without getting 10 yards forward the other team gets the ball

it was you should look it up	i will
true that can be said about a lot of things	i just hope its not as bad as some of their more recent albums
that would be a good reason to like them if you see them play in person	yes but it was more than that
slippery when wet was a good album	there were a lot of good songs
i dont know much about their defense	neither do i but look at rivers gordon gates and keenan allen
the next two movies im really excited about our thor ragnarok and spiderman homecoming	the trailers for both look really good when thor sees the hulk in the battle dome and gets excited is very funny

yeah i know at least with my father there wasnt much music around	yeah my grandparents think what i listen to is terrible
i like the character paul walker played	that is my favorite as well
maybe its just how attacks are to humans	but pokemon attack humans all the time
it sounds like they did a good job in making the movie a bit more thoughtful and not just a superficial summer blockbuster action flick	yes i actually really enjoyed that aspect of it i really grew to like the characters and so when the action started i really rooted and pulled for them youll enjoy the movie they did it right
how did you like it	i really liked that one
not discounting him just saying its easier to get yards when you have huge lanes to run through	and sanders never really had that advantage
kristen wiig is in it too as his wife i read	oh i dont know much about her what other movies has she done
he does have a strange running style	it works really well for him but not for most running backs
bad books young the giant that kind of stuff	oh i love bad books have you heard manchester orchestra
yea both of those were pretty recent	that is cool his stuff is great
i think theyll make some improvements in the season but its going to be tough especially in their division	tell me about it the afc central is brutal with the pittsburgh steelers baltimore ravens and cincinnati bengals

hey pete whats you favorite band	oh thats easy herb alpert and the tijuana brass
casually but i wouldnt say a hard core fan	im not as crazy as some but ive seen him seven times

id say theyre running game is pretty good too	i would say so with levon bell
so what do you think of classical music	its okay i played a lot of it in band class
do you listen to straight no chaser	i do they are fantastic i also like pentatonix
such a tragic lost i know what you mean it does seem with every fast and furious theyre introducing a new character	thats how you keep a franchise going you keep the main stars and you slowly introduce new ones so the audience can grow attached
oh yeah like what	there is a song called revolution number 9 which is super avant garde and long
yeah its because they have a devoted fan base  theyve been really controversial over time though	yeah ive heard about a lot of that  i think its the thrash metal image
i owned something like 20 flannel shirts	wow  i maybe had five
this is like the 3rd movie with rob schnieder turning into something else	the other one i know of is the animal
that girl can really sing	you can say that again  she doesnt need all that auto tune bullshit
i would like to see that	im sure there are metal bands that have done covers of pop songs

how so	well in the book harry repaired his wand first remember when hermione broke it in hallows part 1
did you see hancock	yeah the movie with will smith
chris pine	he was pretty funny
oh good idea which one	you could watch carrie it is more of a thriller than a true horror
thats a good amount of people to feed and water	speaking of waterduring super bowl halftime there are an estimated 90 million toilet flushes
its supposed to be 10° and snowing chances for a heavy snowstorm	great it will be just like the old days
because i really only got to see the beginning half the other half we kind of got interrupted	hey i want to see it with you
yeah you right about that but the pro	the problem is the league should have and should now protect their players even more
do you like eminem more than easy e	yes i think he has some better songs
what makes you say that	hes only 23 and hasnt reached his ceiling yet scary right
yes it is the definition of a classic	i want to watch it
i disagree	but how he cant control everything
now it seems cheesy even vaders voice seems funny to some	but thats how it goes i still like the movies actors and effects anyway

try alabama pines cover me up or basically anything off the last three albums	what are the last three albums

what	i tried i just couldnt get into it
thats true	hes so hottand such a good actor
yes she heals fast and has claws	she is like wolverine isnt she
well the singers would use different types of voices rather than just their regular voice	that sounds really interesting id like to hear it

hey did you hear that there is a harry potter marathon this weekend	no when what channel

why when theyre putting out so much good music today	there are some modern songs i like
i dont think so	well i think youre wrong
she was on carpool karaoke and i was wondering if my opinion was correct given your musical expertise	so what do you think

what do you think of franco de vita	i like hes songs i dont really understand the lyrics but hes songs have a great rythem
yes 1957	who directed it
yeah id love for the nfl to be more international	definitely it would be awesome if other european nations created teams too
well i agree with that	i think you have to watch out for the raiders
that is very scary is this good to watch with families	i wouldnt recommend it since it may scare your children
i believe so  but i would have to check	i honestly dont care who is leading the central as long as it isnt the cubs
that sounds scary  his makeup job in the movie looked real	i didnt like all the sequels as much as the original
i have been trying to avoid spoilers but as far as i understand its about a getaway driver who wants to get out of the lifestyle	that could definitely be a good time whos in it
hey watch their video for the song from yesterday it runs like a short movie	wow they sound artistic
yes if you have seen that show then you have heard her sing	how so
yeah silent bob would look really cool all cloaked up with a light saber	sure i mean the dude already wears a trenchcoat all the time
thats not who has it	what
so anything else you need to know my liege	well what sort of movies do you have in mind
have you seen smurfs the lost village	no i have not what was it like
personally i would say that starkiller base is my favorite it was amazing and powerful plus the lightsaber duel between kylo ren and rey took place there	true but in the original you had hav luke chewie r2d2 and c3po on their rescue mission to save leia that was a really good section of the movie
i just caught it on tv last night it made me think of you	yeah it was difficult to watch in places

it was	will smiths character was really cool too
dan marino for the dolphins against joe montana for the 49ers	who won
i honestly thought it was really inaccurate while dylans music shares elements with hip hop lyricism subject matter singtalking etc he didnt invent it	agreed hiphop has its origins much earlier than dylan in africanamerican music
47 meters down	47 metes down  whats that about
i agree i am hoping this year we will come back	have you ever gone to the superbowl
oh yeah making the band	and he was a great producer as well

yes they are	do you know what other bands sound like them

will smith in movies good or bad	used to be good but bad recently
they have some quirky characters on their roster lately	the one guy from boliviai think qualifies
i wanted to watch it i think its going to be interesting the combination with deadpool	i know i want to watch them together as well
but rappers dont live out those values usually they get caught up in wealth and fame at least the big ones	not jayz he does a lot of good
their drummer is out of this world	why is he that good
what is the song that uses hand noise for the background music of the song	i believe that is called cups or the cup song by anna kendrick
one could argue what he did was bad behavior	yes they could do that for sure
oh no not that again	well they did cheat with you alls quarterback got caught cheating deflating balls so theyd be easier to catch
yes and so was jamie lee curtis	i think halloween is the best of the slasher genre but scream is definitely up there with friday the 13th
i guess so	so its settled
ryan grigson did not get hired as the general manager for the browns though	oh really what did he get hired to do
i think the green bay packers will look even better this year theyre going to be healthier and theyve added more weapons	im looking forward to it as you know aaron rodgers is my favorite current nfl quarterback
oh that is a good movie besides reese who else is in that	ryan phillippe sarah michelle gellar selma blair
i believe so and seems much happier	does he tour
what whats the plot	its not a continuation of 3 its a whole new one
well yes but it has a twist to it  she is not all she seems to be	so she is deviant
i think she has an album dropping this month looking forward to it	one of the songs has already released green light
i love wait until dark	she is strong in her acting in that part
i know and i even like country music	now if it would have been blake shelton with carrie underwood keith urban darius rucker and artists like that i may be interested
our defense does too  harrison had to come out of retirement to play	he could out bench the rest of the team when he retired
yankees are my favorite team	mine is the cubs
dont hear his namea lot when they talk great guitarist	the beginning of pinball wizard is instantly recognizable
do you know he regrets making that song	why would he
i saw a trailer for his new movie coming out this fall called stronger	whats the movie about
do you think he will ever work in the nfl again	its hard to say with all the controversy surrounding him
but has any of them actually done anything since the initial release	sure sean william scott did role models which was a great comedy
usually it is just a few tracks is all	so never the whole thing then
i really had no idea mary poppins was a disney movie	neither did i
really	yeah i like stuff from the 80s
pretty early in monroes career then	yeah she is very fresh faced in the movie
nobody can replace stephen geoffreys as evil or roddy mcdowell in the original	thats true
do you have a crush on him	obviously i do
im really excited about the raiders this season	are they moving to las vegas yet
the soundtrack is so much fun as well	most disney soundtracks are amazing
the more i read i gotta say no and just today i thought he was a pretty sure thing	yeah it really looks more like hall of very good for lee still a solid career just no hall of fame
i always thought theyd trade out of their pick to try to help themselves at point guardthey need experience not youth at this point	maybe well just have to see what happens
im really interested as you said before how it will all tie into batman	yes and possibly superman
i am actually more impressed with tampa	i think they have done some good moves
what are your thoughts on obiwan kenobi in the prequels	ewan mcgregor hes a good actor but hes no alec guiness
i dont know but they definitely know how to play rougher than that	im so glad we can still play flag football as adults
those nonhits are better than the socalled hits on many other albums	thats true most bands never attain to that level of great rock
he knows how to sing for sure	and he knows how to perform
maybe i couldnt tell all spells look the same in the movies	and when they burned down the burrow it was back and fine again in the next movie
dont forget snap yo fingers either that was my go to song when i was getting ready to go out to the club in college	that is a great one
they are both great quarterbacks	i hope the 49ers get a great one soon to help them back to the championship again
her performance was amazing though	for sure i could never do that now let alone if i were pregnant with twins
oh definitely i noticed all the detailed shots they were so immersive in the time period	very much plus the use of sunlight was just beyond gorgeous throughout the film
yeah	i really like princess leia

the steelers look very interesting this time around	yeah  didnt their owner just die
blame the goalie	i am

i heard he puts on a great show	i know people that have seen him and said it is an incredible show
because i accidentally fell asleep watching it on the couch	trust me you missed nothing
i think peyton should have won 4 super bowls with those teams	hey he won 2 and got to 3 super bowls  thats pretty good in my opinion
what is the best movie not to win the best picture oscar	hmmm good question there must be some classic movies that were snubbed
those songs are okay	heavy is so poppy
good point i guess you would have to ask those around him	it sounds like you are coming along pretty well
what seriously	yeah the characters are so boring and static
yeah like a little more conversation that came out a few years ago it was pretty catchy	yes it was i have that on cd over here lets go listen to it
who are some of your favorite bands of all time	i really like white zombie and rage against the machine

it was and it wasnt	to me it was more creepy
was there anyone in it that i would know	john hurt was the voice of the villain
its about a girl who keeps finding herself drawn to the ocean  she goes on a quest to find a demigod named maui	maui  like the hawaiian island

you know cma is in town next week	yeah i know i hate the traffic but love all these free concerts around town
i love the lady	she fits in with the guys
im not saying that its just harder for player to get paid off	you may have a point
that sounds like a decoration not a person and i think its odd that someone named lamp went to the chargers	there was a player named taco who went to the dallas cowboys in the draft too
it is and i really enjoy these kinds of movies they are relaxing	who produces it
he really has become a really great rapper	thats why i think rap god is his best it shows his skills
country is my favorite i love new and old country it doesnt really matter	how about some reba mcentire or dolly parton
yes youre right they got their start there and now are internationally known	what was their first big song
im not a fan of all of tom cruises works but i sure did like top gun	i didnt think that i would like it but i did
actually i think that was supposed to be a prequel to the original	well either way it sucked
thats what i am reading so far	thats a lot of pressure for him
miami versus the washington redskins	wasnt there a strike that year

the pop music industry is saying that ed sheerans popularity is damaging to the music business	how can popular music be bad for the business

if you get a chance to go to one of their concerts you should definitely go	i want to go see green day but they are not touring anywhere near where i live
randy quaid is soooooo annoying in these movies he drives me crazy to watch him	yeah he is a goofy dude and plays the part too well

the big four	yeah megadeth metallica anthrax and slayer my personal favorite is megadeth but many people like metallica theyre kind of like beginners metal
if you start with the altar you probably wont appreciate how much she grows from one album to the next	oh i understand ill buy goddess and let you know what i think

now that you mention it that is a super hard question	see what i mean
yes very he regrets meeting his ex	that sounds very sad ill give it a listen
even the ol we have now could have helped see if he was as good as advertised	its football so hes going to get hit
there sure were a lot of great bands in the seventies	there sure were that was my favorite decade of music
i like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban	is that his third year
you know it is a movie right it doesnt have to be realistic	oh i know i guess if i want to see something that far out just give me a fantasy movie
come on dont be like that	but would you like it
not to me it seems like just yesterday they were rocking the world	you got to face it your old now
it was way better than i expected it to be	for sure i like how it shows how everything started to fall once the empire took control
love it	i really like reba
i dont want to give you any spoilers	who else is in the movie

im not sure yet any suggestions	well what kind of movie were you thinking about
well why dont they have that funny dog in every advertisement hes pretty important	yeah but hes not all that important
that was only two movies wasnt it is it a franchise if there are only two movies	point taken there were the lion the witch and the wardrobe movies
i know some people just totally get into it	well the games are usually good and i really like a lot of the commercials they show
that was great to watch i was so excited when the celtics had the lead at halftime	one of the reasons things didnt work out for them is because john wall had a tremendous game
yeah you see qbs have sophomore slumps a lot	i think zeke will be just as good this year though
some easier ones are the rams twicethe titansthe jaguars and the colts	you just never know week to week
oh you mean chucky	yeah the newest movie came out not too long ago i really liked that one
penny marshall from laverne and shirley	thats her she made a great movie
do you want to go to the park	i dont know how about a movie instead
have you purchased any new music lately	no i just havent heard anything i like thats come out in the last few years
those aliens were pretty dumb for trying to invade a planet that has more water than land	they werent counting on people discovering their weakness so easily

i thought so but had to ask	i also like cinderella
i think youre being too harsh	maybe so
ill admit the first time i saw it i didnt like it	i did why didnt you like it
can you believe that she’s been out as a mainstream artist for almost a decade now	no way have you seen her in concert yet
mine too i get pretty emotional even thinking about him and everything he went through	what kind of cancer did he have again
alright too bad paul walker passed away he was great in the movies	agreed but i think the rest of the cast is great too
there are rumors that it will be out around christmastime she’s releasing buzz singles right now to build album anticipation	i see i can’t wait to hear more from her
i like them because of all the classic bands what about you	i like those genres because of the energy that they have
it looked pretty good in the trailer though im not too sure if ill see it	i think you should you would like it
i agree i dont think anyone could do a better job than him	who knows maybe one day well be reading about johnny depp commandeering a boat
that is going to be one very short program	hahahahaha might make the movie better
you gotta be kidding me tell me youre joking	i will tell you that because i am though actually i always preferred johnny mnemonic
that wont happen	i think it would be funny if the top two teams lost
yes she was definitely made for that role	i also loved the movie it wondering how the remake will be
theres a canadian named whitney rose	yes i like her stuff
is nicki minaj famous for rapping	yes she is in fact one of the top female rappers now
yeah its a pretty good song	rascal flatts did a version of it for the pixar cars soundtrack that was pretty good
it is you should see it  its got a lot of good adventure too	really  it didnt seem adventurous in the previews
yeah they havent lost a game these playoffs have they	no and the celtics have now dropped seven so theyve only saved themselves one game to rest
easily the phantom menace  i dislike jar jar binks	right  what a waste of a character
do you remember the walt disney movie called bambi	yes vaguely though what was it about again
i think its great for the nba	why is that
did you like him in ghostbusters	that was pretty good
youre right but it still hurts because i really invested a lot of my time and money as a fan	well maybe lets change the topic who do you think will win it this year
would you say it could be the best bond movie of all time	no i wouldnt go that far  its one of the best but i cant say any single bond movie is the absolute best
why is that your favorite genre	not really sure but its on the radio and i like catchy tunes
john lennon hands down	im a george harrison person myself also really like ringo star
i like the song that he did with ashanti	which one you know they did a couple of songs together
i really enjoyed the relationship between rey and finn as well cant wait to see where that leads	i know right december cant come fast enough i cant wait for the new movie
yeah and the fact that younger people are more agile and quick	not all the time though some older players are still better than the young ones
what was the shark movie with him	deep blue sea
you are so in a bubble try to listen to twentyone pilots	i was just in a weird mood i usually listen to more alt rock than pop
yeah ive seen some neat stuff too  i wonder what other movies judy garland was in	im not sure  i only remember her from the wizard of oz
i dont know that more adult equals darker but i get what you are saying	did you know that in the one scene where helena bonham carter is writing mudblood on hermione they show it one one arm but then next shot it is on the other
that sounds like an actual plot	yeah but its far fetched
blazing samurai its animated but has a great cast with the likes of samuel l jackson and michael cera so still totally worth it think it comes out sometime in august maybe	cant wait
i completely agree breaking bad was amazing and he did such a great job but i love seeing him doing funny roles as well	yeah i am a huge comedy lover so i tend to watch a lot of comedy movies
the cowboys had a great year last year  bet you never saw that coming	i didnt and hardly anyone else did either  i wouldve never though that romo would not be a cowboy
thats a great song i listed to it prerelease on youtube	same here  as soon as i heard it i preordered it with amazon
its a money grab	i couldnt stand jacob in that movie
who are some of your favorite pop artists	hmm well i really like sufjan stevens and neutral milk hotel
i dont think we need that taylor is good and we have two good young qbs behind them	that is another issue if taylor gets hurt or doesnt work out jones or peterman are not experienced enough
yes it never fails to put me in a good mood	and i also like dont wanna be torn
the colts never really could figure out the patriots in the playoffs	well well look back and realize that the patriots are having one of the best runs in nfl history
alright final prediction for the super bowl	i like the steelers and the giants
i thought that was great	at least they wont do that again
yes supposedly while they were filming they were having an affair	wow  well they definitely had chemistry  the sparks were almost visible
what song do you like of theirs	i like broadway the best
well wish me luck on my second choice should it be princess bride or young frankenstein	i guess it depends if you want to watch a second one with wilder and kahn maybe go with princess bride
whats your favorite type of music to see at a festival	id have to say super jams
i dont know its been a while	what do you think cinderella was about
ill be shocked if hes able to put up good numbers theres a reason he was taken number 12 with two other qbs ahead of him	scouts and gms are obsessed with mechanics and potential to be a prototypical qb watson is not that
i really like paparazzi how about you	i like alejandro
a classic for sure	gippeto really loved his wooden doll
well you cant underestimate the nfc west either with the seahawks and cardinals	i know but the other two are so bad
what was nicholas cages best movie	hes been in some pretty good ones and some bad ones
oh i love their films	me too though they havent been as good recently
i dont know but she looked like she was 60 or so in the movie	what i mean is that its only shocking because youre used to seeing her with makeup which makes her look younger
have you seen any good action movies lately	of course that is my favorite genre of movies
yeah i know  i loved the original xxx	so did i  why did you think it was so bad
yeah i remember she was so cool and pretty	cyndi lauper also made that great song called girls just wanna have fun
gone girl  it was all over the bookstores	yeah i saw that  how was the movie
in a good movie musical you can take away all the songs and dances and it will still be a great story with great dialogue and performances	i see what your saying like grease chicago west side storythe classics
excellent i believe the same	i think it was the best out of all the star wars so far
do you have a favorite genre of movies	comedy is my favorite
well of course they did but what ones are you thinking of	take your pick i am the walrus lucy in the sky with diamonds strawberry fields forever
do you like the song loyalty	its catchy but its kind of cheesy
it definitely earned its r rating  its not kid appropriate	how did ryan reynolds do in it
ive heard that the first album is much more raw and more punk	yes its fast and hard the songs have a garage sound the lyrics are very full of angst and mad at the world which is something i identified with
that certainly is a good way to get the players to do their best	i think thats the whole point of it
it is about the guy getting killed right	yeah but it is really funny situational humor
say a team is down by 10 with two minutes to go but have been making a comeback they get it to within two points	okay
i agree on that it just so nice to have taylor swift and avril lavigne here with us they always have great music for everyday	yeah i loved innocence and 1989 album from taylor swift
wheres that one from	the orginal song is called apache and it was written by jerry lordan but the most famous version is by the incredible bongo band
probably not they played with a band called mannequin pussy at the show we went to	thats an interesting name for a band
what did you think of it its a black and white surrealist film from around 1980 i think	david lynch 1977 reminded me of my old neighborhood in los angeles 1968 to 1972
me too i cant wait to beat you	keep dreaming man im the champ
i gotta catch up	catch up
you should man i have to warn you though its pretty gory	gory like the saw movies
do you like the oldies	yes
with that a 42 win over the san diego padres the brewers are in first place	that win was their ninth in 11 games
who do you think is better katy perry or lady gaga	lady gaga for sure
i agree im not sure if americans have that acquired yearning for rap with deep british accents	not just that but its a grittier type of music too
no they kill off han solo	bummer  he was my favorite
but in the prequels its all entirely cgi  no armor was built as it wasnt needed	ive never noticed before to be honest with you
i hope he stays with the franchise until the 10th i think thats how many they said they were going to make	i heard 10 also i bet if they continue doing well at the box office well get spin offs thatll be fun for all fast and furious fans
i think you are right in fact i think most people dont know	thats sad to me zipadeedoodah is so much fun
yeah live	i saw u2 a few years back
true but kendrick has great lyrics great technique and mass appeal	there are a couple of tracks i like like swimming pools
it was amazing jason baitman was briliant	was it a comedy
what kind of music	juli and sarah are jazz singers primarily suzanna is poprock theyre all solo artists
but thenfirst minute is a recorder intro  and the rest wasnt great either	i had high hopes for this album
what do you think was the best of the christopher nolan batman movies	probably the middle one with the joker
oh yea thats going to be a good game since they are divisional rivals	we are having a football party that day at my place to watch the game would you like to come
pretty much chance or so we think hes basically following her and then picked up something she dropped and introduced himself to her the proceed to go out	this sounds pretty routine to me like a romance movie
what is that about	a russian immigrant defects to america
all these new rappers suck	there are a few good new ones
well anyways nice talking to you	you too
yeah but he saves the day hes a tortured soul	okay so is kylo ren but i dont care about his greasy self
he was a cute character adorable voice	the cat from that film was iconic to me too
seriously well which of their songs do you like then	i want to hold your hand is a nice one
is his contract up	this is the last year on it
chill out man the album isnt that bad and plus i was comparing it to ride the lightning which is the greatest metallica album ever made	umm you really think ride the lightning is the greatest metallica album ever produced
who plays in the nfl	professional football players after college players get drafted by the nfl teams to play professionally
which one is that	slow hands it is kinda mellow but i nice change
yeah i had no idea his wife was gonna be the bad guy	same here
what was the score	5510
i thought the idea was really good but a good portion of the movie just felt so predictable and cliche	whats the idea about
true  and that kirk cousins is the man at qb	yeah he is good hope they can keep him under contract and get him signed long term
drink	drink would have made the crowd go wow why didnt he
oh that is neat  i wouldve loved to see that	yeah and theyve started filming some movies now
treasure planet is so underrated	the soundtrack was great too
i just read that paul mccartney didnt know he was on a rihanna song	what he was like a sample
anyway are you sure you dont want to go to the concert	yes i think ill sit this one out and wait for a tour where they play the old songs
yes he wrote hundreds of songs	did you know he just turned 70
i havent really listened to sza except for that song she has with childish gambino	do you mean childs play
im predicting luke dies in this next movie	dont say that we already lost han
how so he was training to become an assassin after being a basic office worker	yea that doesnt ever happen
maybe but cry me a river was a decent song	it wasnt bad
by the way he also makes music with a other beat maker called biollante	really
did you like it	yes i did shes a great singer
ill call you in a couple of days	later dude
thats not fair that theyre not consistent with play calls	well it is pretty cool when they do break away and go down the court to make a nice play
oh thats a great one mine is yesterday	thats almost a standard definitely a classic
yeah oh well i still think it was a good movie	meh there was too much singing and all the songs get stuck in my head
i guess thats the life of most formerly top artists now a days	yes gotta keep the cash flow running
i loved it	i might have to look into that
what did you think of the storyline	i loved it dory is every parents worst nightmare
yeah it was really cool  she fought to kill some god that she thought was one of the german leaders	that is different
the landscapes were nice	they were
are you going to any vikings games this year	i might but i have to work a lot of the time on sundays
so many i would have to say hello and someone like you	i love those songs too but theyre so sad
yep i love that movie	its been a long time since i have seen it
seen any disney movies lately	yeah
the beatles thats it	well it is quaint
well pick one mine is the original pokemon theme song	okay mine would have to be the weekenders
have you heard of calvin harris	no i havent tell me about him
i didnt know pouncey was in recovery mode	i just found out three days ago
yeah ive looked them up but cant remember them	the way they depict them falling off the cliff in season 2 is beautifullyset the music slows down as they fall
you mean when tommy shoots spider or the part with billy bats	the part with spider that was brutal
yeah for the nfc championship	or philly
why are you rooting for the rockets	well i want to see competitive series  i feel like if they beat the spurs and play the warriors it will be a better series
maybe but they did it way later  you cant listen to something like rock and roll by led zeppelin and not hear chuck berrys influence	so does the person who created the technique get the credit or the person who refined it
yeah its an amazing track so i get it	who is your favorite rapper
so have you gone to any baseball games lately	im not a huge baseball fan but yeah i went to a couple of spring training games out in arizona this year
spotify	oh you always give me some good songs
i love user he is great	why do you think he is great
the 70s really	yeah well people tend to think of it in terms of disco and some of the cliche classic rock bands but a lot of cool stuff was going on
sounds good to me have you heard the new weezer music	no not yet they will be at the concert maybe i will hear it there
well justins was acoustic and pretty laid back but it was good johns was more electric and energetic i loved both shows but my husband enjoyed johns the best	and now the moody blues will be touring this summer
i guess so his verses are still amazing though and the features are great i just kind of miss acid rap chance	me too but artists are humans too they grow and evolve chance is a daddy now he cant be doing acid all the time any more
is it a team in a warm place	it is a team in a warm climate
want to see it again im up for it	sounds good
i think luck has a big year	i do too i bet they win the division
what is your favorite movie genre	thats would have to be action movies
whats it called	hardwired to self destruct
ha ha i can relate	so with the next star trek film i hope they heat things up
i dont know they kind of did their own thing for a long time	they make make you think even when youre having a good time
i hope i can see them one day	their sound is really unique
yes she is so bad ass in this movie	i agree i want her in more movies
whos your favorite band of all time	the only band that matters
oh right i try to forget that movie was made	yeah you cant really fit 60 episodes of a tv show into one movie
i had a date with a girl and we saw the first rocky movie  it was a good movie but the date wasnt so hot	i didnt like to go to the movies on dates it was more fun to go with a group of friends  we could get into mischief too easily  we were thrown out of the rocky horror picture show for making too much noise
it sounds like you do but it was a good movie	yes i just hated the bad lady ursula
yeah i dont like those either although it is amazing what they do with animation now	and all the big stars do the narration so when i do see one i actually usually enjoy it but i dont seek them out
well what else	how bout the rings the points the historical moments the fact he never ran to other teams
well i like champion	okay what else
yup and peaceful easy feeling	its too bad that they disbanded
its one of the greatest crimesuspense movies out there	ive been meaning to watch whats so good about it
i agree he was a great rock singer	i love we are the champions
whats your favorite horror movie	thats a tough one as there are so many ive always been partial to the shining
it is the wu tang clan	ok what makes that album so special
yeah like did they learn or what	i am sure their is more to it
have you been listening to any lady gaga lately	yes i have
what if you had to choose	have to go with ledger he played a psycho so well
hmm honestly i dont remember	oh come on yes you do
yeah its suprisingly good	what band was it that he was in
i have seen a few hawks games live	oh really  how was that
i might try a geometric print maybe on a maxi dress or a skirt	sonia rykiel just came out with a really cool geometric print poncho it was a part of the spring fashion runway show
do you think luke will fight snoke	i think he and rey have to at some point
did you ever get to see the star wars movie rogue one	yes i did
he has a ton of weapons that are big and fast	but very unregarded and undrafted
i just heard poker face on the radio	poker face by who
what is that	sergeant peppers lonely heart club band is a so great
was the movie faithful to the booktt	for the most part it did there were a few changes
oh okay sing a little	take it off for me for me for meversace on the floor
must be hard being a bills fan	yeah right
yeah that sounds good	so do you think donald brown will make a big impact for the indianapolis colts
i believe so	that was so cute when it finally hatched
i definitely could too ive heard that song enough times that is for sure	have you looked at baby einsteins
the saints are in new orleans	how did they do last year
yeah i think hes pretty good too	i actually think they should start him soon and cut brady because jimmy is about to become a free agent
do you think darth vader is entirely bad	he did some incredibly bad things but he also had terrible things happen to him i dont think hes entirely bad but hes definitely done things too horrible to forgive
hi	hey
remember the new england patriots tom brady it was the 20142015 season	no way really how did i miss that what happened
i didnt know they had beef	yeah canibus did a verse on the remix l l thought it was a dis so he deleted the verse from the song
it was a hit by all standards a man in love with his woman being tops	both of your pop artists sung songs about men falling in love
rightly so who do you listen to	i like jazz
i agree do you think he is related to rey	i dont know i could see her being related to obi wan
anyone else collaborate on it with him	well he did a song with u2 but im not a huge fan of it  you just have to listen to the whole album
i agree it makes me feel so melancholy when i listen to it	i feel the same way about my immortal
me too  my favorite is the soft parade	i havent listened to that one much  i heard a lot of people dont like it
why the change of heart	well i got older theyre clearly catered for children
girl you have to know which movie its very popular with the guys it has vin diesel dwayne johnson and jason statham in it	yes i know which one you are talking about now i did see it did you like the movie
i agree with you one hundred percent about that	without a great defense it is hard to win in the nfl
what other songs on on his album i need to download some	no good and all the pretty girls are also really good songs
just pick any theres gotta be one	okay her first album baby one more time is probably my all time favorite
i thought it was good	yeah but you never read the books you dont know what they left out
im trying to remember the name of the designer but it has slipped my mind	i think her name is versace
ya the acting was pretty good too	i was surprised to see matt damon in that
i think what a person doesnt like tells as much about them as what they do like	i see your point so what movies dont you like
either way it works for sure	yeah i just wish i could remember more of their songs
i know youre not a fan of pop music but i really want you to come to a concert with me	i despise pop music i would not be caught dead at a pop concert
you should it will provide a few chuckles	cool im always on the lookout for something funny
yes she even produces her music too	does she write her own songs
when does star wars take place	a long time ago
i actually really like that song	yeah i do too but its just too long
when i was in iraq toby keith carrie underwood and montgomery gentry all visited	you mean they went into a war zone to play for the troops
i also really like adam sandler movies	i think hes hilarious i love big daddy
was it in english	it was in chinese
well just agree to disagree	ill agree youre opinion is wrong
but i liked the two forcesensitive characters like the blind man they were good	i didnt like any one else really except leia at the end
tell me about baby groot	he dances he has a little hot head he is fearless he is a little tree that pertrays to be a little kid  the rest of the crew will die to protect him as he died in the first one to save thier lives
i do not think i have ever watched that one	it is good it is a very interesting role for murphy
even though they were entertainment they were serious	george lucas was a big part of conveying that
same old stuff by a lot of different singers	i like the old country music
kendrick lamars new album damn is spectacular	i loved good kid maad city
yeah but a remake that wasnt bad	you always want to put your spin on things
i didnt know that  can you recommend someone	well jon 5 is an amazing guitar player to spans several genres  hes know for being in marilyn manson but his solo work includes diverse playing styles even chicken pickin
have you been to a ballgame recently	yeah last week

what is your favorite genre of movie	thats a good question i would say horror
do you know any charity that they have been involved in	they have been involdved with the charity mylifespeaks
i am ready to see who lands in quarterback this season	i think that is a no brainer after what happened last year
thats what i thought it could have been better but it was still enjoyable	some people arent feeling the nostalgia i actually liked it a lot and that was partially because of all the feeling flooding back from all the other movies
me too	nice talking to you
then its panthers saints where the divisional rivalry begins	yes the bucs will have to be cautious those next 5 or 6 games
haha youre right that horse is great	way better than mushu
to me this was the most saddest scene in the movie because vader it seemed killed ben	yeah i think that was the saddest scene in the movie
i think the best description is symphonic metal  they have a soprano as the lead singer and have had different ones over time	thats unusual  it sounds pretty good though

and who is the singer	robert plant

yeah pretty much but i do like other stuff as well	what else do you like
i know what you mean it can be difficult to find one in the afternoon	yes i know but i must practice what music are you on your way to practice
i was so scared when the toys were stuck at sids house but the best part was when they escaped	with the help of the other toys the barbie doll legs with the hook head and the baby that had spider legs
their defense is young and theyve stockpiled some talent there	right im not too concerned about that
i saw him at  a concert and when that song started to play he just said blah blah for most of the words	wow thats pathetic
was it good	it was heart touching and very sad too

sledgehammer was on peter gabriels so album	funny how albums are in the dust bin of history now
i thought it was hilarious doesnt seem like lazy writing to me	now that i think about it they kept using the same jokes over and over throughout the entire movie
yes i agree too sam raimi the director had such a strong vision perhaps a better script and concept as well	sam raimi is so good in general i think stan lee being on the writing team makes a world of difference
have you ever heard of little mix	yeah the girl band right

no he just made the movies what they were	vin diesel cant be replaced either  if you lose both of those characters i really dont think you will have much of a fan base

no i have not what kind of band are they	they are considered christian rock
theres so much to look forward to i hope the next one we get more of a backstory on poe too the chemistry between him and finn was great i was sad when han solo died though	that was tragic he gave himself to his son and kylo ended him
what do you think	it sounds like shes trying to sing like adele in it at times honestly
i thought that it was way too long it lasted a solid three hours	oh wow thats a really long movie
ha ha yeah something like that it is such a good film though	yeah i heard they were making a sequel
i think they do alot of stuff indoors anyway	the sets are already built there
there are plenty of people who get injured	yeah its all the tackling
to me its an even more ambitious project trying for more emotional range you get it all here	is it electronicy or all hushed folk music
you do have a point as that could be a huge problem once again	yep i have no idea why they chose not to improve the defense
what happened during the nfl draft in april this year	there were some big suprises including some trades up for quarterbacks
no ringo starr is also still alive	thats right i almost forgot about him

come to think about it she was also in mrs doubtfire	mrs doubtfire is one of my favorite movies of all time
i am sure you can find it online	is that the only well known song on that album
hmm go on	get off when he climbs on her why did finn climb on her to get a view in a plane

i didnt know that but it makes sense	also did you know most of the cast is of polynesian descent
the raiders took huge steps this offseason	the broncos still have that incredible defense
not to mention bill belichick may be the best coach ever	no doubt without him none of this would have happened

how about that andy dalton	andy dalton hes the worst quarterback in the nfl
i like how ice cubes son played cube in the movie	i mean he does look just like him

they did well they had a good last few games	they have only three loses
that i watchedyes	i guess you like him
lord huron hes kind of down low	ive never heard of him any songs
oh i get it the beatles say the beach boys influenced them	exactly hes right about the harmonization i get that part
yes	do you think it sounds dated
very funny but they could do film study and even promotional events  as much as the nfl makes they can afford to pay them for fulltime	ok i agree and you probably would get better officiating
this game is a shoein	dont say that man
what are some other movies with good soundtracks	i love the soundtrack from both guardians of the galaxy movies
what did you think of  the fighting style of the power rangers	it was alright but it could of been better with more believable action scenes

i just dont think enough people knew about daredevil	the character has been further developed no then 15 years ago
so thats your only reason kevin love you dont think the warriors are just better	i just dont think lebron can handle it all on his own kyrie will step up but they really need kevin love this year now that the warriors are even more loaded
were they any good	carrie got mixed reviews im not sure about children of the corn

yeah i like baseball	same here  who is your team
i havent heard that one yet	you should listen to it its hilarious
what did you like about it	the plot and the characters
i saw her do ayo live on saturday night live she was fantastic	i saw it too it was kind of a rockin country song and she did such a great job
oh i didnt know that it looks like the newer one is on	okay i didnt think it was as good as the original personally but it has its own merit
that sounds exciting and frightening at the same time she got caught eventually right	oh definitely but the general didnt have her killed since she previously saved his life
i liked the slow build in to their relationship	the will they or wont they you mean
what restaurant do you want to meet at	the grill
have you seen the official music video of this song	yes i have on youtube and its awesome
no the betterthanexpected teams that are going to come through out of nowhere	you mean only making it because of tom brady or aaron rodgers getting injured
i used to get upset with the new hip hop but then i just decided to spend my time and energy revisiting the older music i prefer	what bothers you about new hip hop
yes but she cant take all the credit for tony yike yang he has such innate passion when he plays	only 1 woman made it to the semi finals rachel cheung
what kind of music have you been listening to these days	mostly pop im totally obsessed with pop music
you ready for the upcoming nfl season	sure am what do you think the colts will do this year
how long have you been playing guitar	about four years i started on my own  i took a couple of classes later now im practicing on my own again
who was your favorite character in the hangover movies was it zach	actually as funny as he was i kind of the guy chow i think he really stole the show in his scenes

cool have you seen it	no i havent seen it i just saw a trailer that said it was playing in theatres now
supposedly rey is going to be a grey jedi	yes i think that will be really neat  or perhaps kylo will be redeemd

well this has been a nice talk best of luck to your seahawks	yes thank you and the same to your pats
yeah i mean it seems wasteful	i dont know i still just listen for the music
i dont know  maybe loosely	well when disney takes things and bases movies on them its usually pretty loose
not with that kind of attitude	not with any kind of attitude besides just about all the qbs would be able to make that probably from 100 yards away
what do you mean everyone likes nfl football	la already has two great football teams ucla bruins and the usc trojans
i think they are mostly british actors so it will feel more real	lets go see it
yes i agree	thanks for talking to me
yes	for which team
i think harper has more power	yeah but not as good defensively
it would be horrible	no more than that
ya it makes you wonder a little about george lucass relationship with his father	probably troubled i think star wars is so universal most themes relate to life so deeply
yeah i think so its just pure goofy fun	speaking of pure goofy fun what about stepbrothers
not really i have a young son so hes not into that	oh okay try watching toy story and see if he likes it
do you ever listen to the beatles	not really but theyre a great band
that is right	speaking of the raiders what do you think of carr

okay ask me one	the best joker in the movies
dude how are your broncos going to do this season	i think lynch is ready to step up man
fantastic	have you seen them before
he did pretty well	do you know who did mators voice
korean pop music relaxes you	it certainly takes my mind off my troubles kpop makes me happy it has done that ever since i started listening to it
its a little too much for me  while interesting its more cacophony than music	i have that albumn but i dont listen to it much
yes thats the one	it is a good movie
yes he has a couple of guys playing instruments and jamming on stage	it sounds entertaining
have you seen the neighbors	yes have you
it definitely was sorry to see dennis green pass away guy was really a good guy who will always be remembered by that meltdown	yes unfortunate he seemed like a good man
yes that goes to show how great he is	i think the 49ers will continue to be bad until they get a new staff
well fish do eat each other sometimes and they die really easily so i told my husband it would be too traumatic	is your son still really sensitive about that
exactly he just wants to see her no matter how old she is	and then he gets her the glass of water and when he turned around its as if she sees him for the first time
the whole team and coaching staff they got sucker punched into thinking san antonio would not try and wait til game 7 when they would be at full strength	that makes some sense but still the wrong way for a professional to behave
yeah	wow i thought it was good but not his best
no manhunter was the first in the series	when was it released
they started 31 at least they were competitive	that means now theyre going to go on a loosing streak
i love dollhouse and soap	ive heard the song soap before its pretty good
jk simmons completely took that role and owned it  man he was amazing	i know  on one hand you hated him and on the other you kind of understood what he was doing
the league really needs to do something about that	i agree fights are entertaining but so dangerous and juvenile
the original one or the newer one	have you seen either
he makes a variety of films i think all his stuff is really good	did you hear he is the new director for the han solo film
how about andre botacelli he is very good	yes he is very good
im sure it was the best live performance i ever saw was three days grace	ive never been to one of their concerts and i heard they lost their lead vocalist is that true
remember his song smooth criminal	remember it i created a dance to that song
didnt they sweep the oscars that year	yes they did  all five best picture best actor best actress best screenplay best director
hi geoff what are you watching	hey zebadiah im watching the lord of the rings
yes it is quite terrifying in the end	i definitely will watch it
really thats a rare one	what do you mean
well i liked the tongue in check humor	but they were so unbelievable
around 2008 i think	wow has it really been that long
i know  it was one of their first songs and probably one of their best songs	they have been through so much its amazing they are still going relatively strong
no way thats awesome	yeah they are only in for a couple minutes though
no it was not and he saved her life another time at the end he told her to get on that board and to be strong and hold on until someone came to her rescue	yes the sad part was he ended up dying along with all the rest of the people who either jumped off the boat or fell in that cold water and died also
that is a good point	they let ray lewis keep playing even after his murder trial
yeah i cant wait for the final one this december	me too
that movie is really cool	i like the cgi in it
thats the one i would pay large sums of money and give up large sums of vital organs to go see him perform	oh man me too wacken sounds awesome
i think thats what i mean	yeah and like that music video of their i sent you i thought was a good example of that

just recently gregg alllman	yea he was great
you can feel it she really puts her soul into it	yeah its what shes know for
yes they are basically the pioneers of grundge rock	i had no idea
h was flying on ben afflecks plane and let bens nanny try on his super bowl rings	bradys wife gisele seems like a tiger i doubt she liked that
well pg13 wasnt a thing yet you know why that rating was introduced eventually to deal with spielberg	he got his own custom mpaa rating i guess hes claimed his place in history then
yeah and even though those can be entertaining for adults theyre not exactly made for adults	i guess it would be weird to see a theater of just adults watching a pixar film
yes im going to see them play the bucaneers	when is that game
have you heard of memento	yeah i saw it on netflix a while ago
sometimes  especially music from carmen	carmen was the first opera i ever saw  it was great
well maybe they have said something to the celtics	hopefully also hopefully they tell him to fix his hair  its terrible
when	one day
like when the simpsons movie came out that was really kind of an event	i dont think anyone thought it would actually happen until it really did
ok ill send you the details via email i cant wait for the season to start either	ill be going to training camp to watch tom brady practice with brandin cooks
yes with a tank top and button down shirt	or a sweater something that hangs nicely nothing too fitted
i have no idea	her and blake seem like such a wierd couple

im hoping so  he had such a good rookie year	he did and so did zeke
how do you feel about something corporate	are you talking about the band
right middle school was a wild time	remember we always used to listen to the jonas brothers too
they get to kill valek  his partner turns into a vampire  woods lets him go	sounds pretty interesting
how are quarterbacks in more danger than the average player	if you think about it quarterbacks are basically sitting ducks when theyre just standing in the pocket looking for a passer
i agree it fundamentally changes the character	it kid of does when han shoots first it shows he is willing to kill before he gives someone the chance to kill him
ya it may have been disney most popular movie in a long time	well what about the star wars films
she was amazing too	yeah she was their songs were so great when they sang together
who are your favorite teams	my favorite teams are the eagles and the packers
me too i was constantly quoting i love the land war in asia thing	my favorite is to say inconceivable in a silly voice
it seems as if all of the rap songs are about drugs and money	yes and they are very hard to understand
what album is freebird on	i know it is on gold and platinum  that album has all their greatest hits
that is a long life	it really is
even today when a song comes on from the movie i can picture what was happening	hunh its like you dont have to watch the movie anymore you can just picture it in your mind
the simpsons aren´t they like old	yes but they made a modern movie on 2007 which is hilarious
the amount of skill it takes to harmonize with four other people is beyond me	i bet they practice non stop
lets talk about pop music what is your favorite current hit	i am liking anything by bebe rexha right now
hmm great song but mariah carey couldve sung it better	ah no beyonce is a legend
you know the touring company is currently in chicago	we should get tickets to go see it that would be a treat
meg foster stan shaw and i think michael papajohn	johnathan breck still playing as the creeper
i agree i mean she is dead	exactly hopefully theyll find a great way to edit the story so her death makes sense even if thats not what i want
no	he plays these figures on the guitar like it was a piano he was tapping on the strings super fast
yeah they only tour in the west	i cant even remember what they play
have you seen alien covenant yet	not yet have you
ok change that for the music scene	dont have answers for that right now
yeah  im not sure either	the action looks good but the plot seems a little confusing
yeah the most lame action movie	thats hard to say because if the action is weak then it is no longer considered an action movie
why are all these guys wearing denim shorts all the sudden	who knows probably some hipster trend
garth brooks was the biggest star at the time	i think people are tired of it though and they have come back to pop
you bet	my kids love the mascots
its a shame too they are so talented and people miss them	yeah but their music will always be there for us to hear
i like him as well we have a lot of his movies	great i have liked him ever since i saw we were soldiers
what happens at the end of return of the jedi	i think you should watch it
i think i love all their music	me too
how long have they been around	they have been around since the early 90s and i believe they still tour today

kurt russel	that guys pretty good

mabel meets a guy and when she tries to join him on his boat her exchange family sisters dupe her and take off without her	okay so they leave at the pier so then what happens

i also like debussy	i dont think i know him
oh yeah	yeah i really like his back story
yes she was a nut job	she did play a good nut job though
i think the saying goes too many accessories clutter an outfit  this look had bad horror film written all over it	my other favorite looks of the night were rita oras red marchesa gown and zendaya really stunned in the gorgeous satin dolce  gabbana off the shoulder gown
really i love them  how can you not be a fan of the actors in those movies	i love the actors in the movie  i love the rock jason stathem etc
what do you think about despacito the new song with luis fonsi	i like it a lot i think it has a great rythem
oh this one is really good like the others	what is this one about
they narrowly missed the playoffs last year and i think they have a good chance this year	they do because theyve added some good veterans and some good talent in the draft
i dont know its been advertised everywhere	so whats it called
do you think they will play each other for the third year in a row	i dont see how they can be stopped
hes only 28	looks like his contract negotiations arent going so well for this season

isaiah thomas hook shot from outside the court behind the backboard	haha that was messed up

what do you think of mariah carey	she is alright i like her songs
i dont know how old is he now	hes got to be close to 40 hes played for a while now
i love that hardknock life song	the one like annie

the guy that had his arm caught in between rocks in utah	oh yeah james franco was the star
how do you think it will turn out	i think the indians will probably win this year with all their players being healthy again
that is for sure  my favorite song is  is aerosmiths  angel	i was just going to ask you who yours was  wow i have not heard that 1 in a while
yeah bautista did a bat flip after hitting a homerun	i think every team hates that guy

did you ever hear about the deflating scandal	no what is it
i was surprised the score was 00 after the first quarter	what was the score at the half
just jam and express my self i mean it cant be that hard	well youll need at least a year of practice first do you have the time
the green screening really hurt the prequel trilogy	in those movies the cgi looks badly dated now
lordes lyrics are pop genius though	i dont think that she could be better than taylor swift
another one	yup
i mean the western genre  the kind of movie that usually has cowboys in it	i guess so i dont think theyve made any in a long time
it is possible that they will go that route  i wonder if rey will make her own lightsaber	i think that she will continue to use lukes  maybe she is lukes daughter
yes and basil and him fell off the clock tower	i was so scared hed actually died as a kid
so what do you like to do for fun	i love to hit the open road and travel whenever i get the chance
i bet you if anything that the last beatle to die will be ringo starr it looks like its going to be that way	just our luck i wouldnt doubt it since paul mccartney had already died one time back when the beatles were barely making it
she loves going to games with me  shell bring her hot sister too	hey there  id like that even better if shes a falcons fan

thats so interesting i never knew lady gaga and tamar were connected in some way	i know they are actually good friends
they didnt play the panthers either lets try san francisco they ran 126 yardsgame	ok dallas won that game 2417 now we have a game to check out metric against so we have 49ers 126 yardsgame gained average against cowboys 835 yardsgames allowed

i liked that cinderella movie	which one
i loved single ladies	that was a fun song
lets do that and see what we can come up with	next big smash hit
im not sure but if it doesnt start for a while we can grab something to eat	sounds great
that was on the white album and eric clapton played the lead guitar	i heard something in the way she moves is one of the top covered songs of all time
yeah that part is too funny the dog comes to the rescue and saves the day	then at the end jim carey swallows the dynamite to stop the building from blowing up so clever
aww you should show them its a great movie	yeah i will i loved it
yeah and he kidnaps these girls and his various personalities torment them	but wasnt one personality trying to save them
so youre saying women are hypocritical	if they love this song and hate it then possibly
pretty badly still the vikings arent doing well nowadays	perhaps theyll beat the broncos today
so lets say you had to pick one batman movie it has to be the best which one	does it have to be the nolan ones
that five year run was koufaxesque in an era where players were supermen	yeah thats gotta count for something but hof is usually compiled stats and you got 300 wins as a benchmark
true but rizzo and bryant arent putting the ball in play very much either  tons of strikeouts	i understand i think its just too early to judge
it is there are a lot of featured artists on the album	great ill listen to it tonight

i like all his albums its just this kickback kind of music	yeah i have favorites on every albums in between dreams is awesome

it was great to see vader at the end of the movie attacking and going all out	definitely a moment long time fans wanted for years and they delivered

oh yeah thats an older one but its great	i know  did you know he used to be the lead singer for hootie and the blowfish
hi what kind of music do you like	i like all kinds but preferably jazz music
yeah hes great in all of them i think theyre all worth watching besides tokyo drift	maybe one day if i catch one of the movies on tv
yep how do you think theyll finish up	well nobody in the central is really good either so probably theyll win the division at least

do you think it will be a good one	i think it has potential

i used to really like watching the celtics back when larry byrd played  i guess that was 30 years ago or more	me too because my exhusband was a huge celtics fan his whole family loved anything irish

why were luke and leia sent to different families on different planets after padmes death	to make it more difficult for darth vader to find them

i have seen a great many that he directed  he is the master of suspenseful theater	what is your favorite alfred hitchcock thriller
do you like to watch them on tv later	i dont like to have them interrupted by commercials  it sort of breaks up the story

i have a lot of movies what are you in the mood for	to be honest i would like to watch something funny with a lot of action
you i cant wait to see green bay run the season	green bay get out of here they are not going to the superbowl this year
i think they get upgrades	they look more modern in the newer movies
do you think they could ever be a superbowl team	definitely maybe in another five years
why what makes it your favorite	it gets me pumped up the beat is just so good
did you ever listen to the music group live	oh yeah  i actually saw them live in concert a long time ago
an orphanage nuns munks and wrestling	sounds a bit eclectic
true i heard they really play as a team cleveland must really be excited that their team was a contender for a world series title	maybe they will make a run for it again this year especially if francisco lindor stays hot
one of his best movies  and an early apperance by the guy who plays howard on the big bang theory	i like luke wilson in it too
i guess youre right  plus kids love them too	yeah and how about when luke and leah revealed they really are siblings

did you know thats playing in revival this week	really  lets go
yes after the musicians finished their final concert a group of students including myself were still outside one of the musicians asked us why we were still waiting and when he heard we were musicians he invited us in	thats cool did you get to talk with him about music
how so	well had we won more of the first four games we would not have been in the wild card and would have more time to rest in the playoffs
ive never seen bambi either	well thats not so bad you didnt have to be traumatized as a kid like everybody else
this is just such a cool sound	its like punk folk right

carrie underwood does a few and it is really just beautiful even if you are not into christian music	i think it is the emotion they convey i like the elvis song about a pocket full of is it rainbows
you were dreaming again	dreaming and you woke me up
i bet they have a winning season	i hope you are right and i am wrong
wow a true man of talent	yes one of my favorite movies that he was in was castaway
you must not have seen any other movies this year	what makes you say that i thought it was great
yeah that makes sense the story overall wasnt that great but i just like these types of thrillers	same here just a move you can chill and watch doesnt require a lot of thinking
can you elaborate	i just think that their dynamic in the force awakens was great without the romance  it could maybe detract from the story
i love horror movies myself	you do
i just started dating a girl who told me that her favorite genre is mumblecore what do you know	have you heard of hannah takes the stairs
the ref ben dreith made a phantom holding call on ray hamilton it won the game for the raiders	i remember that wellit still irks me

yea carson palmer is getting older but they do have a couple players	yea they have had a strong defense in the past but i dont know if they still do
yeah her  didnt she die	yeah like ten or fifteen years ago

hes 10 im not worried about his college plans	well i want to develop all my players to the best of my abilities
they should do a duet sometime	that duet would make peoples heads explode

oh im laughing	cmon i was like 13 and i saw the sign was a hit song
there is nothing like being at a live sporting event	i agree and nfl football is my favorite
what about classics like mulan and beauty and the beast	the old versions are great but have you seen the remake of beauty and the beast
dont know they always say they arent and end up doing one	well action movies are always a good watch

yes as lord voldemort	doesnt harry like an asian chick in this
that and dessert	so was he cute
mine is crazy little thing called love fun facthe composed it in a bath freddy got inspired by everything	yeah england got that one right they are so proud they even honored the band by releasing a postage stamp in a commemorative gesture
like what school spirit or something	i guess
yeah like old school funk and smooth r and b	kind of reminds me of prince as well
the new star wars movie comes out this year	yeah im looking forward to that

have you seen the latest jennifer garner movie	no i haven´t which one are you talking about nine lives or miracles from heaven
and i think they got another new head coach this season	yeah chip kelly one and done
what is break beats	its a sub genre of techno
i find a lot of good movies on tv too	simon pegg has been in so many comedies
i first remember seeing her in butch cassidy and the sundance kid i wonder if she kept in touch with her costars in that movie paul newman and robert redford	paul newman was one of my favorite actors of all time ive heard theyre going to use his voice in the upcoming cars 3
oh i dont do well with those types of movies	its not that bad though just a few scenes
she is so great i love when shes taking a bath	and his claws come up

me too a lot of stuff these days is mainly about drugs and stuff like that	i completely agree
peyton has 12	ok but what else do you have eli is still better in my mind
how do you like pixies	who are they
yeaa lot of pop songs sound the same	too many sound the same
i heard that too but i am not sure what her role will be yet	i also heard that the next movie is going to be a little darker
im a kansas city fan  love the chiefs	yeah i live in kansas city now so i root for the chiefs too  unless theyre playing the hawks
i havent seen all of them  i guess i should	well its hard to beat the original
so whats it like	think of modern karaoke to an orchestral background
theres a lot of good storylines in the nfl this year what are you watching	so much as always the patriots will probably win it all
george lucas made the films correct	yes he did and he did a great job i believe he was young when he made them too
true he may be underappreciated in hollywood	or maybe by audiences since he is rarely the main draw he may get overlooked for people like leo super alist
yeah it was not as good as crazystupid love though	oh yeah that was similar and great kind of like love actually
i gotcha	they also make really good verses like rhyming
do you like the beatles	yeah my brother listen them alot
what do you think about movies with subtitles	honestly i do not watch them  i do not want to have to read while enjoying a movie
how many movies have you seen in theaters in the last year	maybe two three
have you ever heard a song called a hard days night	yes i have heard it on an oldies station at my job brings me great memories
yeah and like this album from what ive heard of it anyway its the same thing the rest of the morning benders stuff isnt very good	how does that happen i cant understand how a band can make such a mindblowing album but then turn out mediocre work
and it is so catchy	yes i play it all the time
whats the best star wars movie	my favorite has always been return of the jedi i loved boba fett and the ewoks
i guess that any video is better than the official video	drop it already the 2010 video is completely professional it was directed by geremy jasper and edited by paul snyder
yeah not much plot	exactly
maybe let me think	okay take your time
so who do you got anyway cavs or warriors	oh warriors for sure kevin love wont show up for the finals
yeah trueit was a poor effort didnt even make top 100 on billboard	hes lost his touch i suppose
i think once they come in they have to start throwing right away	yeah they practice in the back and then come in and throw more pitches
i especially love the comments on why a play succeeds and why another play fails	this is why football is so great  i cant wait for the season to start
thats the way to go youll want to see the detail on every mountain and wave	so is it your new favorite disney movie
yea it was exciting to watch but not a very strong plot line	i see it does fit with current social issues though
its an older movie but dennis quade and louise gossett jr starred in it	what was it about
did you like it	yes i thought it was great
is that the meet me in montauk movie	yes it is
who would you compare them too	thats hard to say some songs sound like youre listening to old school wilson philips and others make you think of pat benatar
yeah i was not always a packer fan but i have been since 1991	who did you like before that
rodgers is getting up there in age	no i think he is playing just like he should be
how did you get into blues	my dad was a big fan and he played a little blues on guitar as well
sure did and the thing with the late 60s is pop and folk started to merge into what became the counter culture protest music	thats so interesting
i also like their song favorite girl	i havent hesrd of it
anyways nice talking to you	same to you
yes it is do you know what the final group is called	it is called percussion because you hit the instrument with a stick or mallet thats my favorite group
yeah but there are still great movies nonetheless	we should watch it together sometime
hi	hi
im a braves fan so i dont have much hope	you must be really disappointed that freeman got hurt
yes  it is so perfect it hits me in all of the right spots	with the way the hem goes from high to low i bet that would be a great salsa dress
bebe rexha	thats the name i really like her single i got you
what harry potter book was the best and which movie was the	the forth book and seventh books were the best
wanna play a game	sure
i am sure some of the producers helped her with that	no doubt
i think one died from an overdose	did you like the song how deep is your love
it really is one of the better types of rock music	i think there is something they captured in the 60s and 70s that cant be recreated
seriously	yeah i think it was much over hyped i liked seeing harrison ford and carrie fisher but not the new people
the yankees look really good this year	yea they could do well this year
well  mark  falls in love  and it winds up his  exwife has a  jealous  husband  just  like how the movie  starts	so its one of those  films   that goes  full  circle
wow that sounds intense	yeah you should give them a try
what year did it come out	it was released in 1941
i mean it wasnt totally satisfying but i think thats the point	i dont know i was pretty disappointed by it
youre not going to at least listen to the song	i will
guess what i listened to this weekend	i dont know what
stop messing with me	ok ok just kidding it is good though
im not saying they were unbeatable but if the pass threat had been there you would have only heard kellys praises sung	hopefully he gets another chance
no they actually sing really well their harmonies are really great	impressive where did you say id find them
yeah same here	hes a great artist
you know who didnt write very many songs ringo	ringo didnt sing in many of the songs either
until darth vader threw him down the big hole	yeah that was a pretty wicked demise
i like them as well which songs do you like the most	my favorite from them is that song i melt
who are they	a metal band from the 70s
crosby is the player that i love to hate  he has been given a golden skate by the officials and gets away with everthing   he never sits in the penalty box	at least the flyers did not make the playoffs this season  that team has one good player claude giroux but the rest of them like to whine and they pick on pittsburgh
it was	i hope other people appreciate that movie as much as me
that was nice of you	she recently died so i now look back at it as a good experience because she and i were together
they just released a new song called champion	do they have a new album coming out too
what else do you like	i like etta james and nina simone
what was your favorite movie	i have to say the first one
a girls mom dies and she goes to go live with her dad and they raise geese together	that sounds cheesy
i think jim carrey use to be	why dont you think he is now
the draft more and more is the key for teams	i knowand then they dont have to overpay
oh my god i love skylar grey  shes my favorite vocalist and she also plays piano	oh awesome  what type of music does she play
i like prayer for the dying	that is also enjoyable to listen to
they say thay every year about him	true but every year he does get older
wow that must have been a great experience	it sure was i will remember it for a lifetime
pyromania is one of their best albums in my opinion	i will have to check that out sometime  what are some of their songs
i am definitely going to see it the first weekend when it comes out	the team up with iron man looks super fun in the trailers
i also like revolver thats really an underrated album and really brought psychedelic music out of its shell	you dont hear too many people put that on their beatles lists but youre right it is an influential album
i dont know this seems like its trending everywhere	i dont get it dont people call them jorts
have you seen the movie hook with robin williams	yes i did not care for it i would like  to know peter pan as the kid who never grew up

yeah sure same guy	what lines are you talking about
well obviously	i cant believe that leonardo dicaprio actually played a bad guy hes always so nice

well what do they do	all their songs are about ancient egypt
did you see his last interview with david letterman	yes  he has such a great dry sense of humor
i really like mark hamill i wish he was in more things	hes always cast as the villain when he acts elsewhere im excited to have him as a hero again
yes they did	right and they probably went to a big party where they embarrassed them selves in fron of the girls too
that movie was so silly	thats why i liked it
you know it	i cannot disagree
is that a band	yeah thats their name  nothing
wow aaron rodgers is still there ya know	i understand that but hes getting older
whats a lighter metal band	iron maiden is like classic metal that never gets too heavy and is very melodic
yeah man hes good	it had on the edge of my seat
star wars though they knew what they were doing	were they i didnt see it
with all the counter melodies and harmony	that was queen though  they really just brought it to a new level
there dont seem to be as many fights on the ice as there used to be	everything is changing in sports i think the owners want it to be more family friendly
whos your favorite country singer	brad paisley is probably my favorite although i prefer his old stuff
joe pesci was funny in the second one	he was a cooky character
it is did you like any of his collection	i like a few pieces he makes a sort of gauzy broken up shirt in cream and it is really attractive  did you
right on	your turn
the name isnt ringing a bell but tell me what happened	he fathered at least 11 children by 10 different women and owed child support for 9 of the kids
do you like ariana grande	shes good i dont have any of her albums though
he was my favorite singer growing up	i thought the beatles were
i know it was so sad to loose such a great voice to the world	it was he was so creative and theatrical in his performances
oh this is miami	why are the uniforms periwinkle blue
do you like hard rock	i like more 80s hair metal rock
okay now you	i liked edm a lot
yeah but maybe thats just to be punk rock and difficult	maybe or maybe it was just the early eighties and nobody had ever thought of being googlesearch friendly did you check out tsol
i know its been like 30 years	yeah michael keaton will fit the part even better
i mean he played like garbage the majority of the year but look good in the playoffs	that is until he got hurt
did you ever get a chance to see the tron sequel	no not yet is it any good
that was the year that coldplay beat beyonce for record of the year	oh yeah for what song
im not sure if this kid ever gets off of the ground	you think they traded away all those picks for nothing
what we know from magic when he joined the dodgers the man loves a splash	george would be a splash but isnt it better to wait
oh yeah i love older metallica stuff like battery	so kpop isnt anything like metallica is it
and then it fell off on the 2nd one	well with the success you always do a sequel
dude have you seen his stats	yeah and they dont impress me
i dont know it just feels disjointed	whats disjointed about it
diamond heart and joanne are my favorites on it	i will have to check it out
ill make the time and then we can sing some songs together	kareoke style and impress our wives
i wonder why the beatles got so popular	well because they were good
i enjoy watching the classic nfl cities the best the ones that actually get snow	yeah like chicago bears cleveland browns pittsburgh steelers
really its one of the best films ever made	you hadnt seen it either until recently
i know you do these two play off of each other really well great chemistry	what do they sound like
i agree that was a very intense scene but also a lot of fun to watch	what scene stands out to you from the movie
a lot of their success is due to their coach bill belichick	thats true hes been coaching since 1979 and worked with various teams
i listen to that sometimes	i love garth brooks
did you like dredd	i think dredd was great
especially the jets game	double overtime  so exciting
have you seen jennifer lopez video calledon the floor	yes that is a cool video
the nfl is betting that the fans will adjust and get over it	some fans are not going to like it  i guess it is just the new way things are being done
indeed the second john wick movie felt like it needed to end on a cliffhanger to have another sequel just to do well	i still liked the soundtrack score for both movies
no rogue one came before all those	thats right  they paved the way
i had no idea edison was so heavily involved with it	yeah he did quite a lot to contribute to film
i recently read that there used to be a special achievement award that is no longer around  would be a perfect category for him	especially if motion capture isnt going to be a category yet
what is the most impressive stat of his to you	he was the fastest player in nfl history to reach 30000 passing yards
he hasnt even been given a legit roster yet	yeah but you dont see much progress
do you prefer their earlier stuff or later	i dont know  it depends on my mood
im scared about the quarterbacking situation we seem so lost	who even is on the roster hackenberg and petty
do you think the fights help with that	maybe a little there is something about watching a fight that keeps some fans coming back
the guy kept seeing this weird rabbit	seeing a rabbit
too funny i guess you would have to sit down and plot out everything that is star wars and make a time line	i agree you definately have to spend a little time and work it out

do you mean hybrid theory	oh yes i love that cd
jalen richard might help be a big help with for the raiders this season	yeah he was good last year for the raiders
i think the best i can say is that the movie was set in a different time period and that the hangman could not show any sort of weakness if she had been a man he would have been hitting a man the fact he treats a woman so bad is addressed a few times	but no one actually does anything about it right
when you are in the same division as the patriots you cant expect to much	ya they are beast to contend with
it was good but not as good  this one is funnier i promise	okay i will have to watch it

whats your favorite violent movie	violent movie let me see are we including horror movies or just action

who else do you think	i think the atlanta falcons may go all the way
on the whole yeah i mean the cast gives a great performance	robin williams and matt damon are both great in it
thats a shame because he was a music genius when he put his full energy and time toward music	yes for sure
i heard rumors but not sure	yeah you never know if you just hear rumors
i dont think the beatles could have made it to where they got without martin  that guy knew some serious tricks	yeah it was crazy  im sure what brian wilson did with pet sounds gave them a lot of ideas as well  i think thats why paul wanted to do sgt pepper in the first place
i like them both too but especially ryan	well then you probably saw lars and the real girl
music wise i like rock pop and edm	edm
is that it	well i think he has a good heart and is an interesting character because of that
i know  but he meets nala and they live happily ever after	like all disney movies right

you wanna know something	sure tell me
my son loves singing let it go im going crazy	i know what you mean the soundtrack is playing nonstop in my car my daughter wont let me play anything else
oh that doesnt matter dak prescott will be great	yea but can he lead his team
i think it might be my favorite too the original is always best	the second and third ones are pretty good too
a fair amount its quite interesting being surrounded by a whole seen like for example being in the middle of the band performing or having a music video happening all around you	it seems like it would be a natural match for electronic dance music
yep  one is the drummer  the singer plays everything else	like what
hes funny	ill look him up and ill check on that channel on pandora
what is your favorite science fiction movie	i would say alien
yeah when iowa came out i remember thinking it was the angriest release ever	i used to play the song left behind on repeat

i was a big fan of acdc as a kid	isnt axy their lead now
i went as a third wheel to a few movies with my buddy  we saw every which way but loose it was pretty comical	i saw the dirty harry movies most of them clint eastwood was cool to watch with his tough guy acting
oh yeah i remember that scene  that was pretty cool	i agree but it was waaaay too short  the should have built that guy up a little more maybe have something interrupt the battle and them have them fight to the death later or something
i will give pop a chance	it will grow on me i guess
that is true and they had it pretty bad	i know they had to clean all day it was bad
